consultant psychiatrist in charge of Ms Beavington’s care did not give the FY1 any
instruction as to how to challenge the decision that the consultant believed was wrong.</span>
Instead, the consultant instructed the FY1 to leave it for three days and then just try again in
the same way. By this time, Ms Beavington decided that she had waited too long and did not
want another attempt to be made. Ms Beavington was discharged home and killed herself at
1am the next morning.
We would like to begin by expressing our deepest sympathies to Ms Beavington’s family and
loved ones. We recognise the profound impact of her death, and our focus in this response
is to outline the actions we are taking to strengthen our systems, prevent similar incidents,
and ensure that those in crisis receive the right support at the right time.

This response has been prepared collaboratively between the community and hospital

reduce future risks.</span> To ensure that these changes are embedded, we will continue reviewing
declined referrals through governance meetings, identifying patterns and making further
improvements as needed.
Key Areas Identified in the PFD Report & Actions Taken
The PFD report identified several key areas where improvements were needed to prevent
similar situations in the future. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety + care + contribute + care + patient">Below, we outline each concern and the actions taken to
address it, ensuring that all measures directly contribute to improving patient safety and
care.</span>
By way of context, crisis houses at the Trust exist as an informal alternative to inpatient
admission. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor
Keywords: referral">We have 7 crisis houses available across the Trust and since we merged as a
single organisation on 1st November 2024, we are working hard to standardise referral
processes and practices across the 7 houses and 5 boroughs.</span> This is being led by a newly
appointed band 7 crisis house lead dedicated to this work.

Act; they are community based low support settings.</span> Because of the setting each house has

These updates directly address the concerns raised in the PFD Report by ensuring that:
• No referral is declined without a formal escalation and risk review process.
• Decision-making structures are clear, with defined accountability at all levels.
• Out-of-hours pathways are explicit thereby reducing gaps in governance and
response times.
• Risk documentation is standardised and linked to escalation pathways thereby
ensuring oversight.
• The Crisis Hub Health Professional Line strengthens real-time clinical decision-
making thereby ensuring urgent cases receive immediate senior input.
• Training and system updates reinforce staff confidence in risk-based decision-
making.
• These improvements are monitored through routine governance reviews, thereby
ensuring that lessons are continuously learned and embedded into practice.</span>

These updates directly address the concerns raised in the PFD Report by ensuring that:
• No referral is declined without a formal escalation and risk review process.
• Decision-making structures are clear, with defined accountability at all levels.
• Out-of-hours pathways are explicit thereby reducing gaps in governance and
response times.
• Risk documentation is standardised and linked to escalation pathways thereby
ensuring oversight.
• The Crisis Hub Health Professional Line strengthens real-time clinical decision-
making thereby ensuring urgent cases receive immediate senior input.
• Training and system updates reinforce staff confidence in risk-based decision-
making.
• These improvements are monitored through routine governance reviews, thereby
ensuring that lessons are continuously learned and embedded into practice.</td>

        Bainborough.
On behalf of HMCTS, I write to provide our response to the matters of concern addressed to
the Magistrates’ Courts in your Report to Prevent Future Deaths, dated 18th February 2025,
following the inquest into the death of Mr Bainborough.
The Coroner’s MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(1) During the Inquest, evidence was heard from 2 consultant psychiatrists and an Approved
Mental Health Act Professional (AMHP) regarding the timescales for applying for and
executing s135(1) warrants. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: concerns + time">All of them had concerns about the time taken for a warrant to
be issued and executed
(2) The warrant application was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023, the
hearing took place on 23 August and it was intended that the warrant would be executed on
7 September 2023.</span> This was a timescale of 20 days. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The jury was told that this timescale
was typical of the time taken to apply for and execute a s135(1) warrant in the experience of
the professionals giving evidence at the Inquest.
(3) Applications for a warrant are heard at Westminster and Uxbridge Magistrates Courts
which consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: needs">There are a limited number of
video hearing slots, so AMPH teams may have to wait several days for a hearing.
(4) Once a warrant has been issued, an appointment then needs to be arranged for police
officers to execute the warrant.</span> The evidence before the court was that it would generally
take in the region of 10 days for an appointment to be scheduled.
(5) There is no official fast track procedure. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: time + risk, assessment">Consequently, there is a risk of harm to the
individual and others during the time taken for a warrant to be granted and executed.
(6) As individuals have been identified as requiring assessment under the Mental Health Act,
the risk of potential harm is recognised.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

HMCTS Response
On behalf of HMCTS I offer our apologies for the delay in submitting this response to your
report dated 18 February 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">Following some unfortunate internal misdirection the report
was only received in the correct part of the MOJ in June and we are grateful to have been
allowed time to investigate before providing our response.</span>
Our initial investigation concerned our position in relation to the Inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">Bearing in mind the
content of the Prevention of Future Death reports which contain clear criticism of the service
provision by London Magistrates’ Courts, we express our surprise that the MOJ (HMCTS)
were not considered as falling within the status of Interested Parties to be joined by the
Assistant Coroner under s.47 Coroner’s and Justice Act 2009.</span> The results of our
investigations below would indicate that we had potentially relevant evidence to give in
relation to the operation of systems for considering s.135 Mental Health Act warrants. The
Assistant Coroner has reached findings based on the witness evidence of other professional
colleagues but without the evidence of HMCTS witnesses.
Understandably, in these circumstances, we are now grateful for the opportunity to provide
our insights on this sad case.
Responding to the relevant parts of the ‘matters of concern’ in Mr Bainborough’s case
using the coroner’s numbering:
1) Listing is a judicial function and responsibility and arrangements for the operation of court
lists are agreed with the judiciary and implemented by HMCTS. Arrangements for s.135
MHA warrants fall into these arrangements
Our listing arrangements categorise mental health warrant applications as priority one work.
<span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: allocation + time">Where necessary other work
types will be adjourned off to prioritise the allocation of court time to deal with priority one
work.</span>
Prior to the pandemic, a mental health practitioner who was applying for a mental health
warrant could attend court and apply for the warrant. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy + policy">HMCTS operated (and still operates)
an open-door policy for this category of priority one work.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: care">At the beginning of the pandemic
there was a duty of care on HMCTS to protect court users and to embrace, wherever
possible, remote ways of working.</span> HMCTS swiftly responded and introduced a remote
application system for mental health warrants, accompanied by an online booking system for
applicants. The success of this system was such that once pandemic protection measures
were removed applicants asked for the system to continue.
<span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: needs">The search warrant remote process was specifically designed to meet the needs and
demands of the 32 London boroughs it serves.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Since the inception of the remote process
HMCTS has provided daily access to two separate, remote warrant sessions through
Monday - Friday.</span> The system is set up as online self service, which means applicants can
select hearing dates and times for their applications. Where sessions have been booked in
advance, it is not unusual and indeed is commonplace for applicants to cancel slots, those
slots are released back to the booking in system.
This business-as-usual model ensures that HMCTS, on average, provides more warrant
slots, than the applications it receives daily. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy + policy">Alongside the self-service online booking
process, HMCTS retained and retains an open-door policy which is widely known and
accepted practice and procedure.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">This process invites applicants to attend court, which
provides immediate access to a court room, where the mental health warrant application will
be listed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

with such applications, in order that they can be directed to their local courthouse.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: local + team">However,
should an applicant attend a local courthouse without contacting the centralised
administration team, it remains the practice that the court will accommodate the applicant,
given the nature and priority given to such applications.</span>
<span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Additionally, the court provides a daily out of hours service for such applications, ensuring
that the ability to apply for a mental health warrant is not hampered or impeded by a lack of
access to the Judiciary.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Again, there is an over provision of this service, to ensure that there
are no delays in the out of hours operations.
2) Whilst there is a maximum number of hearing slots within the online booking system, the
applicant’s access to a court hearing is not limited to the online booking slots.</span> It is long
established practice and procedure for mental health practitioners to attend court and apply
for urgent mental health warrants.
<span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Additionally, HMCTS provides an out of hours service 7 days a week, where an applicant
can access the Judiciary to apply for an urgent mental health warrant application.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">As a result
of the various access routes to obtain an urgent mental health warrant, there is no need for
an applicant to wait several days for a hearing.</span>
Evidence presented to the Inquest confirmed that the application was made on 18 August
with an intended date for execution on 7 September 2023.
On that basis, it clearly follows that this was not regarded as an urgent application.
The warrant was considered and granted on 23 August, 3 standard working days following
submission. There is no delay attributable in this case to the court listing process on a non-
urgent submission.
Had the application been considered and assessed as urgent, as above, emergency
procedures are well established for applications to be made within the working week – and
out of hours on a 24/7 basis.
<span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">Noting the response provided by the Metropolitan Police, it is also clear that additional
powers are available in case of emergency alongside the provisions of s135 MHA should
these have been required.
3) As above, the application was considered 3 working days after submission.</span> Had the case
been considered urgent, established procedures existed. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

4) This matter does not apply to the magistrates’ courts responsibilities.
5) I interpret the reference to the absence of official fast track procedure as relating to the
police element of the procedure, i.e. arrangements for execution of the warrant. I note that
the Metropolitan Police confirm in their response that they have no official fast track
procedure for execution of warrants. This is not the case for applications for warrants to the
magistrates’ court. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: between">Perhaps, on consideration of evidence in the absence of any from
HMCTS, there has been a conflating of process here reaching a conclusion which is contrary

6) Immediately on receipt of this report and in response to exchanges between HMCTS and
NHS colleagues, we have re-iterated the arrangements for applications to be made to
magistrates’ courts in London whether routine, urgent or out of hours.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff

We take a neutral position on the Chief Coroner’s decision on the release and or publication
of our response, save to point to the potential for any additional distress to be caused to the
family of Mr Bainborough by the noted disagreement between HMCTS and NHS positions
which were unable of being resolved during the Inquest process given our absence.</span> We are
content that the Chief Coroner will use diplomacy accordingly given the sensitivities to the
family.
We thank you for the opportunity to provide these observations which are designed primarily
to give assurance that our magistrates’ court arrangements are suitable for the urgent
consideration of these important mental health warrant applications, necessarily prioritised
under our joint arrangements with the judiciary in full recognition of the vulnerability and risks
to patients and the public.
We hope this contribution has been of assistance and confirm our standing commitment to
working with colleagues to continually improve services.

        I am writing further to the inquest for Mr Duncan Holloway which concluded on 16th January
2025 and following which you issued a Prevention of Future Death report to the British
Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and North London NHS Foundation
Trust (note, not North West London NHS Trust). The inquest found that Mr Holloway died by
suicide after at around 5am on 18th July 2024. The matters of
concern raised in your report in regard to the Trust are as follows:
Mr Holloway was seen and fully assessed by North West London clinicians when he was
taken to hospital by police following an episode of self harm on 30 June 2024. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

this incident, which it will share through its various governance forums as part of its
commitment to learning and improvement.
I hope that this response provides the necessary assurance. Please contact me if you have
any queries.

Dear Coroner,
Re: Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths – William Stephen Green
who died on 9 July 2023.
Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 28
February 2025 concerning the death of William Stephen Green on 9 July 2023. In
advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to
express my deep condolences to William’s family and loved ones. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about William’s
care have been listened to and reflected upon.</span>

patients on the side-effects, and what to do if side-effects are experienced, when a
patient at The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital is initiated on a new prescribed drug during
an admission.</span> Your Report also raises that there is no provision in place for patients
who lack capacity to understand an explanation of the side-effects of prescribed drugs,
even when this may be offered. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff

        Power Stadium on 27 October 2018. We acknowledge the significant effort and dedication that has
gone into this inquest, and we are grateful for providing the European Union Aviation SafetyAgency
(EASA) with the opportunity to respond to the concerns formulated in the Prevention of Future Death
Report arising from this tragic event.
As you are aware, EASA assisted the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the UK in the safety
investigation into this accident in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 996/2010. As
mentioned in our previous submissions, there has been some topics on which we could not reach a
common understanding, and that included the root cause of the accident (cf. ‘Appendix K of the AAIB
Final Report). Nevertheless, we understand the importance of these safety recommendations and
have approached them with the utmost seriousness and consideration. Our decision regarding these
recommendations were not taken lightly. They have been carefully produced according to a formal
internal procedure that involved various subject matter experts from within the Agency, as well as
management review.
In the context of aircraft certification, it is crucial to ensure harmonization of certification requirements
applied by aviation authorities around the world, with the primary objective of ensuring aviation
safety. EASA is committed to working closely with other regulatory bodies, including the UK Civil
Aviation Authority (CAA), to achieve this goal. In fact, we have been in contact with the UK CAA and are
aware that they are exploring certain concepts related to some of the safety recommendations
proposed by the AAIB. We are open to engaging in consultation with UK CAA to assess the merits of
these proposals and to discuss potential ways forward.
However, at this point, EASA maintains its position as already communicated in response to the AAIB's
safety recommendations. For the sake of convenience, the latest responses to those recommendation
that are reconfirmed in point 5 of the PFD as ‘Coroner’s Concerns’ are recalled in the annex to this
letter. We believe that our positions, as outlined in the annex, address the safety recommendations

raised by the investigation. At the same time, EASA is working on other improvements to the rotorcraft
certification process to address lessons learned beyond AAIB’s safety recommendations. The Agency is
committed to ensuring that any regulatory changes are proportionate, effective, and aligned with
international best practices.
Once again, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to respond to the Coroner'sPFD
report. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation

2023-023, 2023-024 and 2023-025
AAIB reference 2023-018:“It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency amend
Certification Specification 29.602 to require type design manufacturers to provide the results of all
relevant system and flight testing to any supplier who retains the sole expertise to assess the
performance and reliability of components identified as critical parts within a specific system
application, to verify that such components can safely meet the in-service operational demands, prior
to the certification of the overall system.” [EASA reference: UNKG-2023-001]
Final EASA reply sent on 06/02/2024:
“Pursuant to point 21.A.20 of Annex I (Part 21) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, the applicant for
aircraft type certification is responsible for the demonstration of compliance with the type certification
basis (that includes certification specifications), and to record justifications of compliance within the
compliance documents as referred to in the certification programme.</span> This implies ensuring that parts
and systems reach minimum performance and reliability targets.

Keywords: information + design">Therefore, the applicant is responsible for providing any information such as, but not limited to, test
results to its suppliers to ensure a final airworthy design.</span>
This principle is not specific to certain products and should not be repeated in each Certification
Specification where a supplier could be affected.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) considers that the above-mentioned regulatory
framework, including Certification Specifications, is adequate and does not envisage creating new
prescriptive requirements.”
AAIB reference 2023-019: “It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency
introduce additional requirements to Certification Specification 29 to specifically address premature
rolling contact fatigue failure across the full operating spectrum and service life of bearings used in
safety critical applications.” [EASA reference: UNKG-2023-002]
Interim reply sent on 06/02/2024:
“Point CS 29.571 (Fatigue Tolerance Evaluation of Metallic Structure) paragraph (d) of Certification
Specification for Large Rotorcraft (CS-29) specifies the following with regard to Principle Structure
Elements (PSE):
“Each PSE must be identified. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies

between the engines and rotor hubs, controls, fuselage, fixed and movable control surfaces, engineand
transmission mountings, landing gear, and their related primary attachments.”
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) considers that this includes critical components
within the rotor control mechanism, such as the tail rotor duplex bearing of the AW169.</span>

Acceptable Means of Compliance AMC1 29.571 (introduced with Amendment 11 of CS-29) addresses
Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) which should be included, when applicable, in the fatigue tolerance
evaluation of Principle Structure Elements (PSE). <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">This AMC describes possible steps to be taken to
minimise the risk of crack initiation due to RCF on PSEs (and in particular for integrated bearing races).</span> A
fail-safe approach is recommended wherever possible, such that cracking of the affected structural
element(s) is detected prior to its residual strength capability falling below the required levels
prescribed in CS 29.571(f). In addition to following a fail-safe approach, inspection and retirement
times may be needed in order to ensure that the assumptions supporting the fail-safety and detection
of failure remain valid throughout the operational life of the component.
EASA is however reviewing the opportunity to clarify the scope of application of AMC1 29.571, and
similarly of AMC1 27.571, to ensure that critical bearings are always considered. A proposed
amendment of CS-27 and CS-29 is planned to be included in the next Notice of Proposed Amendment
under rulemaking task RMT.0128 ‘Regular update of the Certification Specifications for Very Light
Rotorcraft (CS-VLR), Small Rotorcraft (CS-27), and Large Rotorcraft (CS-29)’.”
AAIB reference 2023-021: “It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency define

        INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEATH OF RICHARD MOHAMED FEKRY OSMAN
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY RESPONSE TO A REPORT ON ACTION TO PREVENT OTHER DEATHS
PURSUANT TO REGULATIONS 28 & 29 OF THE CORONERS (INVESTIGATIONS) REGULATIONS 2013
Introduction
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (‘CAA’) would first like to express its sincere condolences to the family
and friends of Mr. Osman.
The CAA is a public corporation, established by Parliament in 1972 as an independent specialist
aviation regulator. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: safety + local">The CAA works so that:
• the aviation industry meets the highest safety standards,
• consumers have choice, value for money, are protected and treated fairly when they fly,
• through efficient use of airspace, the environmental impact of aviation on local communities
is effectively managed and CO emissions are reduced,
2
• the aviation industry manages security risks effectively.</span>
<span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment + review + equipment">The CAA has carefully considered the Regulation 28 Report to prevent future deaths issued by the
Assistant Coroner for Carmarthenshire & Pembrokeshire dated 5 June 2025 (‘the Report’), which
includes the following recommendations that are relevant to the role and functions of the CAA,
insofar as they apply only to aircraft registered and operated within the UK:
… That a full review of cockpit fire/smoke procedures be undertaken to include, but not limited
to:
- the recognition of an oxygen fire (identifiable by a characteristic noise comparable to that of
a blowtorch) and the immediate cutting off this oxygen supply.
- the installation or carrying of protective equipment to deal with any cockpit fires.
- a review of the effectiveness of Halon fire extinguishers to deal with onboard fires.
- a review of regulations (if required) to prevent the use of cigarettes in the cockpit and related
flammable items and materials.
- the additional risk analyses to take into account the hypothesis of an overpressure in the
oxygen distribution system.</span>
The CAA was not an Interested Person at this inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

evidence.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: safety + information + sensitive + review">When preparing this response, with a view to explaining the outcome of its review, the CAA
has relied on the information contained in the Report, together with regulatory information and safety
data held by the CAA and input from regulatory subject matter experts in civilian flight operations,

The CAA’s Approach
The CAA has acknowledged the concerns identified by the Assistant Coroner. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment + safety + equipment">In particular, those
related to the risk of oxygen fire onboard a commercial aircraft, cockpit (‘flight deck’) fire/smoke
procedures, the effectiveness of equipment for dealing with fire and how the current aviation safety
regulation framework works to prevent such incidents.</span> This response addresses the
recommendations in the report, specifically in relation to large commercial aircraft. It outlines the
relevant regulatory requirements, the measures in place to mitigate and respond to such risks, and
the CAA’s role and function in overseeing these processes.
The CAA is not responsible for the investigation of aircraft accidents or serious incidents on behalf of
the UK, which falls to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (‘AAIB’), a body who report directly to the
Secretary of State for Transport. Procedures for these investigations are laid down in international
protocols, specifically the standards and recommended practices defined in Annex 13 to the
Convention on International Civil Aviation, Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, and published
by the International Civil Aviation Organization (‘ICAO’).
The CAA understands that the Department for Transport (‘DfT’) will, therefore, respond separately to
those aspects of the Report which relate to aircraft accident investigation. We can confirm that we
have exchanged responses with the DfT prior to filing this response with the court.

Managing fires onboard commercial aircraft
The regulatory framework is designed to address both the prevention of onboard fires, as well as the
ability to detect and respond effectively should they occur.
Under the UK Air Operations Regulation, large transport category aircraft must carry fire extinguishers
in the flight deck and cabin, with at least one located in the flight deck. The number of additional
extinguishers required in the aircraft cabin are linked to passenger capacity17 .
Halon fire extinguishers have traditionally been used by commercial aircraft operators to meet these
requirements due to their effectiveness in confined aircraft environments. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

        Al-Jundi
Thank you for your letter and Regulation 28 report made under the Coroners and Justice
Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.
Firstly, I would like to express my sympathy to the family of Wessam Al-Jundi at the loss
of their loved one.

Safety Executive (HSE), as highlighted by the key issues quoted below:
“Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a
satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year
surveillance programmes.”
“Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in
completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure”…..….”there appears to be an
absence of safe working conditions, with no adequate water suppression systems for the
dust created, in adequate respiratory personal protection equipment and absent or
inadequate ventilatory systems.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment

requiring employers to put in place measures to prevent workers being exposed to
hazardous substances, such as artificial stone dust containing respirable crystalline silica
(RCS).</span>

I understand that you are in contact with our lead investigator who is examining the
