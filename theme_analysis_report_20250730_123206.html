Deceased name: Jacqueline Langworthy

This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | HSE | The Lift and Escalator Industry Association
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Minister of State for Health The Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive The Lift and Escalator Industry Association 1 CORONER I am Linda Lee, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 24 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Mary LANGWORTHY, 61. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, heard before a jury, from 7 July 2025 to 10 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Accident The cause of death was: 1a. Asphyxiation 1b. 1c. II. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Miss Langworthy was an experienced care assistant who had recently begun employment at a care home, where she was shadowing more senior members of staff. The home was equipped with a platform lift, intended for transporting wheelchair users accompanied by a carer. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment">It was also used to move bulky equipment, although care home policy prohibited staff from travelling in the lift with equipment.</span> For reasons that remain unclear, Miss Langworthy entered the lift with stand aid. As the lift descended, the wheels of the stand aid caught on the edge of the lift platform, causing it to become wedged and pin Miss Langworthy against the wall of the lift shaft. Although she was able to call for help, Miss Langworthy could not reach the controls. The platform continued to descend, suspending her mid-air. By the time she was freed, she was unresponsive, and resuscitation was unsuccessful. An experienced HSE engineer examined the lift and confirmed there were no mechanical defects in either the lift or the stand aid. The engineer found that, once the downward toggle switch had been activated, the platform continued to move under latch control, placing the controls out of Miss Langworthy's reach, as she remained trapped above the platform. The platform could not be stopped via the control wall pressure switch while descending. The engineer noted that such risks were known within the industry, with a history of wheelchair users being injured in similar circumstances. She explained that "hold-to-run" controls - now a requirement under current standards (BS EN 81-41:2010)—would likely have prevented the incident, as the passenger would be expected to release the control in the event of danger. However, the lift pre-dated this requirement (BS 6440:1999), and such standards are not applied retrospectively. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Many platform lifts still in use in care settings and other premises do not have hold-to-run controls. (2) Evidence was received indicating that such controls can be retrofitted at relatively low cost. (3) There is limited awareness of both the risks posed by the absence of hold-to-run devices and the feasibility of fitting such devices to existing platform lifts. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organization have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The Food and Safety Team at Coventry City Council I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Signature Linda Lee Assistant Coroner Coventry and Warwickshire

Deceased name: Gareth Tatchell
Coroners name: Aled Gruffydd
Coroners Area: SWANSEA NEATH & PORT TALBOT
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: ABMU HEALTH BOARD
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: CHIEF EXECUTIVE ABMU HEALTH BOARD 1 TALBOT GATEWAY BAGLAN ENERGY PARK BAGLAN PORT TALBOT SA12 7BR 1 CORONER I am Aled Gruffydd , Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of SWANSEA NEATH & PORT TALBOT 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 19 th of June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gareth Wynne Tatchell. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26 th June 2025. The medical cause of death is 1a) pneumonia 2) squamous cell carcinoma The conclusion of the inquest as to how Mr Tatchell came to his death was a narrative conclusion and is as follows:- the deceased died from the natural cause of pneumonia having undergone treatment for squamous cell carcinoma which had returned at the time of death. The delay in providing treatment more than minimally contributed to the deceased's death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased was Gareth Wynne Tatchell and he was pronounced dead on the 9 th April 2024 at Princess of Wales Hospital, Swansea. The cause of death was pneumonia. Squamous cell carcinoma was a contributing factor in his death. Gareth was referred to the maxillo-facial team at Morriston Hospital on the 12 th of April 2023 by his dentist following the discovery of an ulcer in the lower left mandible. The referral was classed as an urgent suspected cancer (USC) and Gareth was seen in outpatients clinic on the 28 th of April 2023. Cancer was suspected at that point, specifically a squamous cell carcinoma but it needed to be confirmed by a biopsy. That biopsy took place on 18 May and the result came back on 30 May as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Gareth was seen again on the 19 th of June and further tests consisting of a CT of the thorax, a CT angiogram of the legs and an MRI and ultrasound of the neck were undertaken on the 28 th . Care was then transferred to the treating consultant maxillofacial surgeon who first saw Gareth on the 6 th of July, and then on the 27 July to discuss treatment, which would consist of surgery and radiotherapy. Due to theatre capacity, the earliest date being 13 September. By the week prior to surgery Gareth had developed a lump both inside and out, meaning that the lump was visible on the outside but it would also have spread to the blood vessels in the neck. The surgery was able to remove the tumour macroscopically i.e all that was visible to the naked eye, but as it was encasing the carotid it would not be possible to remove it all. In February 2024 the treating consultant saw Gareth in hospital after he had gone in to have the AAA repaired. It was then that Gareth complained of a pain in the neck which prompted the CT scan showing an enlargement and a biopsy then confirmed that the cancer had returned. Gareth was discharged from hospital following the AAA repair but was readmitted to hospital on the 8 th of March 2024. He subsequently passed away in hospital on the above date. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest it transpired that the Suspected Cancer Pathway introduced for the whole of Wales in 2019 required a suspected cancer to be diagnosed and staged within 31 calendar days of the date of referral and for treatment to commence within 62 calendar days from the date of referral. In this case the diagnostic and staging phase was completed in 97 days from the date of referral and treatment commenced within 144 days of the date of treatment. The result of that delay was that it made the carcinoma more difficult to treat in that it would not have had the extracapsular spread or the encasement of the carotid that was witnessed at the end of August and which was not present around the end of June when treatment ought to have taken place. Had the timescales had been complied with then treatment would have been administered before extracapsular spread had occurred. Evidence was received from the treating consultant that this contributed towards Gareth's death. Evidence was heard that since this incident there had been an improvement in theatre capacity with additional theatre sessions having been allocated to oral and maxillofacial surgery, and an additional Consultant Maxillofacial Oncological Surgeon has been appointed to undertake both surgery and outpatient appointments. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. There was a delay in both the diagnostic and staging phase and treatment phase contrary to the timescales in the Suspected Cancer Pathway. 2. Part of the delays resolve around the time taken to undertake staging scans for the purpose of the diagnostic and staging phase. 3. Two Associate Medical Directors have communicated that delays in undertaking staging scans are ongoing and are having an impact on survivability rates and prognoses by making treatable cancers irresectable. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND/OR your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] . I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 28 July 2025 HM SENIOR CORONER ALED GRUFFYDD

This report is being sent to: East Midlands Ambulance Service | Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Police | College of Policing | Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust | Department of Health and Social Care
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Chief Executive, East Midlands Ambulance Service 2 Chief Constable for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Police 3 College of Policing 4 Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 5 Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Ms Alexandra Pountney, Assistant Coroner for the coroner's area of South Yorkshire (West) (sitting in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire coroner's area). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST An investigation into the death of Kaine Regan FLETCHER was opened on 28 September 2022, and the final inquest hearing is currently being heard by me, sitting with a jury. The final inquest hearing started on 30 June 2025 and concluded on 25 July 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kaine was a 26-year-old male with a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and a history of substance misuse. On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. The officers requested assistance from the Street Triage Team, a team formed through collaboration between Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who duly attended to assess Kaine arriving at 17:04. The Street Triage Team comprised of one police officer and one community psychiatric nurse, travelling together in a marked police car. Kaine was assessed by the community psychiatric nurse not to require a Mental Health Act Assessment, and so the police did not exercise their s.136 powers. Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall. The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46. On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. EMAS advised the family member that the incident had been logged as a Category 3 response, and that there was an 8 hour wait for an ambulance. At 00:33 a member of Kaine's family called the police to report their concerns. A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment. He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle. During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance. He arrived at 03:47. Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. The cause of death provided by the Home Office Pathologist is: 1(a) the physiological effects of exertion following a period of restraint, combined with cocaine and other substances. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: This PFD should be read in conjunction with the PFD that I issued mid-inquest, dated 17 July 2025. 1. Lack of joint agency policy/cross-sector working on Acute Behavioural Disorder/Disturbance In September 2022, the Royal College of Psychiatrists issued a position statement on Acute Behavioural Disturbance and Excited Delirium. The RCP recommended that: - A cross-sector working group should be convened to develop an interim consensus on ‘ABD', with active involvement of patients and carers, to agree terminology, key principles for professional guidance, and priorities for further research. - This group should include representatives from police, custodial, ambulance, emergency medicine, mental health, and the judicial and coronial system. Support from relevant government departments would help ensure consistency across services. - Further research should be urgently commissioned, including detailed investigation into how racial bias plays into the application of terminology such as ‘ABD'. - Members of the cross-sector working group should collaborate on the development and delivery of training materials for staff working across public services - All services should seek to improve standardised collection of disaggregated data on presentations and outcomes, and to conduct regular multi-disciplinary reviews to support high-quality research on this topic. I have heard evidence that in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, no such cross-sector working is in place or joint agency policy is in place. I have also heard that there is no knowledge of such cross-sector working or joint agency policy in place within the East Midlands generally, or nationally. The consequence of this is that there is no joined up thinking, procedure or policy, between front-line services who are regularly dealing with cases of ABD. That lack of collaborative working between services gives rise to a risk of future death for persons who develop ABD both in the community or in custody. People at risk of developing ABD often also fall into categories of vulnerability, such as suffering with a mental health disorder or using illicit substances. To my mind, this increases the risk of future death in the absence of any collaboration. I am concerned that this appears to be a national issue. 2. Lack of agreed joint agency policy between EMAS and the police on s.136 MHA 1983 detentions I issued a PFD on 17 July 2025, part way through the final inquest hearing, to raise my concern over the apparent confusion with both the police and EMAS as to the applicable joint agency policy dealing with s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance. Since that PFD was issued, the evidence has developed and the position at the end of the inquest was as follows: - The police confirmed that the document titled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" has been ratified within their organisation and continues to remain the relevant joint-agency policy for s.136 detention and conveyance. This policy has been implemented for the police since its inception. - EMAS cannot confirm whether the above policy has been ratified in its current version within the organisation. They have confirmed that an employee at EMAS signed off on the 2021 version, but that this information was never disseminated within the organisation because the finalised version of the policy remained within that employee's email inbox. The consequence appears to be that EMAS has never implemented this policy, rather they have been working to an internal policy for Mental Health Conveyance that contains different working standards. Acknowledging that there is no confusion for the police as to the relevant policy, and that they do consider that it has been implemented, I remain concerned. My concerns can now properly be formulated as follows: - There is no joined up thinking between agencies on the local policy for s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance. For a policy to be effective, all purported parties to that policy need to know it applies to them. - Internal disorganisation within EMAS has culminated in a situation where, even after a period of investigation between 17 July - 25 July, they are unable to tell the Court which, if any, joint agency policy applies to them. They are unable to tell the Court whether they are still part of the relevant working group. EMAS have allowed a situation to perpetuate in which they appear, on the face of the policy documents, to be party to an agreement (which includes service level agreements for conveyance) when they simply do not know if this is correct. The upshot of this is that other agencies may be placing reliance on the conveyance terms within the policy when they are dealing with s.136 detention. My concerns are supported by the guidance available at ss. 16.30 - 16.35 of the Mental Health Code of Practice, which highlights the importance of local policy for s.136 detention. It does not appear that the is compliance with this guidance, published by the Department of Health. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">The lack of joined up thinking between agencies locally gives rise to a risk of future death for persons detained under s.136 MHA 1983. 3.</span> Police use of an ambulance as the mode of conveyance for s.136 detainees I heard evidence that the correct mode of conveyance for persons detained under s.136 MHA 1983 is an ambulance, save in exceptional circumstances ( e.g. where the detained person's behaviour means it would be inappropriate, or where the wait for an ambulance would exceed 30 minutes). I also heard evidence, that in the last 12 months an ambulance was called by the police in only 50% of s.136 detentions. Of that 50% in which an ambulance was called, an ambulance only attended on 50% of occasions (so 25% of the total detentions). Of the nine police officers that gave evidence to me in this inquest on s.136 matters, none of them knew about the police policy on calling an ambulance to convey a s.136 detainee. Two of the officers knew, anecdotally, that an ambulance was the preferred method of conveyance, but their evidence was that it was common for an ambulance to take well over 30 minutes or not turn up at all. I am concerned that: - There is a training issue within the police in relation to s.136 detentions and the correct mode of conveyance. Either officers do not know that they should call an ambulance, or they are ignoring their training/the instructions that they are given. This is born out in the statistics above. - There is a response issue on the part of EMAS. This may, in part, be explained by the policy/service level agreement confusion within EMAS. 4. Police training on s.136 MHA 1983 detention and mental health I heard evidence that there is no national training for police officers on the correct wording to communicate a decision and the reasons for a s.136 detention to the detainee. Further, that there is no specific training in relation to persons who are struggling with their mental health and who may be under the influence of illicit substances. I am concerned that training in the area of mental health generally is lacking, which is impacting upon the approach of the police officers dealing with mental health related incidents. 5. The availability of the Street Triage Team I heard evidence that Nottinghamshire is pioneering in its provision of a Street Triage Team, a service that has been available since 2014. This team is comprised of one police officer and one community psychiatric nurse who can travel to mental health incidents to provide assessment and advice to the response officers, particularly in relation to exercising s.136 powers. I heard that this service is available between 8am and 1am, and that the resourcing of the service (both in terms of the shift patterns and the available cars) was determined by analysis of a data set in 2017. At the time that the incident arose with Kaine on 3 July 2022, no STT was available as it was out of hours. I am concerned that there is a need to review the data to ensure that the demand for the service in 2025 is still reflected by the shift patterns. I am concerned, based on the evidence that I heard from EMAS in relation to an increase of ~60% in mental health related calls, that the demand for service may have changed since 2017. I note that the Mental Health Code of Practice includes the following guidance at [16.23] in relation to triage and s.136: " When deciding that detention may be necessary, the police may also benefit from seeking advice before using section 136 powers in cases where they are unsure that the circumstances are sufficiently serious for using these powers. Local protocols should set out how this advice can be provided and who the police should contact, including outside of normal business hours ". I am concerned that I have not seen any local protocol as to who the police should contact out of hours, and I note that EMAS do have available mental health nurses between the hours of 1am and 8am. This again appears to be a local policy and communication issue. 6. Mental Health Services - ‘the gap' I am concerned that there is a ‘gap' in mental health services for those people who have a dual diagnosis of a recognised mental health condition, combined with a substance misuse diagnosis. Clinically, I understand that substance misuse can provide a barrier to effective treatment of any mental health condition. However, I have heard evidence that there is no service available to patients for management, monitoring and treatment in circumstances where they are unable to abstain from substances but require care for the residual mental health condition. In circumstances where it is clinically recognised that substance misuse can exacerbate the symptoms of many mental health conditions, this gives risk to a clear risk of future death. The evidence that I have heard is that once treatment or referral options for these patients have been exhausted, they are discharged from the Local Mental Health Team with signposting to other services e.g. substance misuse services/charities or CRISIS. These services often required self-referral, which is not realistic for many people in these circumstances. Kaine fell into this gap, and I am concerned that there is a risk of future death for other patients if this gap is not filled. Again, it seems to me that this is an issue of national concern. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to: Kaine's family All other IPs who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 25 July 2025 Ms Alexandra Pountney Assistant Coroner South Yorkshire (West)

Ref: 2025-0379
Deceased name: Jordan Babb
Coroners name: Tom Osborne
Coroners Area: Milton Keynes
Category: Community health care and emergency services related deaths
This report is being sent to: Milton Keynes Urgent Care Service
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . Milton Keynes Urgent Care Service 1 CORONER I am Tom OSBORNE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jordan Michael BABB aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion The deceased died of a pulmonary embolism which was not recognised or treated despite presenting with abnormal clinical observations suggestive of this condition. The decision to discharge the deceased without further investigation or escalation of care contributed to his death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had been complaining of chest pain and had visited the Urgent Care Centre in Milton Keynes on Friday 13th September 2024. He was assessed and put on a nebuliser for his asthma. He was discharged with a follow up GP appointment. He was not investigated for a possible pulmonary embolism. On the 16th September 2024 he collapsed and despite resuscitation died of a pulmonary embolism at [REDACTED]. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. Failure to Escalate Abnormal Observations Despite the patient presenting with a significantly elevated heart rate, high respiratory rate, and reduced oxygen saturations — all indicative of physiological instability — there was no escalation to secondary care or referral to the emergency department. There appears to have been no formal threshold or protocol in place to ensure that abnormal observations of this nature trigger an urgent clinical response. 2. Lack of Structured Risk Assessment for Pulmonary Embolism Although pulmonary embolism was a relevant clinical possibility, no structured risk assessment tool (such as the Wells score) was used or documented, and there was no attempt to apply an evidence-based diagnostic pathway as recommended by NICE guidance (NG158). 3. <span style="background-color:#D6D8D9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Active Failures- Mistakes

Keywords: mechanism + mechanism">Risk of Repetition in Similar Settings The inquest heard no evidence that the walk-in centre has a specific protocol or decision- support mechanism in place for the recognition and escalation of potentially life-threatening conditions such as pulmonary embolism.</span> There is a risk that similar failings could occur in future, particularly where patients present with non-specific symptoms and abnormal vital signs. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19th September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Family of Mr Jordan Michael BABB I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 25/07/2025 Tom OSBORNE Senior Coroner for Milton Keynes

Deceased name: Wessam al Jundi
Coroners name: Lydia Brown
Coroners Area: West London
Category: Product related deaths | Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths
This report is being sent to: Department of Health & Social Care | Department of Housing, Community and Local Government | HSE
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Department of Health & Social Care 2. Department of Housing, Community and Local Government 3. HSE 1 CORONER I am Lydia Brown, senior coroner, for the coroner area of West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION On 23 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Wessam al Jundi, age 28. The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not yet been heard. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Diagnosis of severe silicosis lung disease. Awaiting lung transplant. Admitted on Friday 17th May 2024 for potential lung transplant to Harefield Hospital. Had deteriorated since last review with pulmonary hypertension. Bedside echo showed severe pulmonary hypertension with pericardial effusion and left ventricular compromise. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: too unwell, not suitable">Not suitable for transplant as too unwell.</span> Deteriorated and died in hospital on 22 May 2024. Cause of death 1a Respiratory Failure 1b Silicosis (Occupational lung disease) Wessam had been working with artificial stone products which contain a very high percentage of Crystalline silica content. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust">The dust created when these products are cut, sanded and carved creates respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and is too fine to see with normal lighting.</span> It is recognised to cause silicosis if inhaled which causes a hardening or scarring of the lung tissue with initially no symptoms. Once silicosis develops it is untreatable apart from offering lung transplantation. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust, exposure to">The health risks are almost entirely preventable if exposure to dust is adequately controlled. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: exposure to">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - This young man presented with an untreatable lung condition probably caused by exposure to RCS in his workplace.</span> This company, "Yes, Marble Ltd" is no longer trading. Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year surveillance programmes. In this case exposure appears to have commenced in May 2016 and he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2021, a mere 5 years after initial exposure. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust, unsafe conditions">Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure.</span> Australia has already taken the decision in 2024 to ban these artificial stone products. There are a number of patients in the UK currently awaiting lung transplants due to RCS exposure from their workplaces. The last 2 decades have seen rapid growth in the use of artificial stone and this death demonstrates the emergence of a severe progressive accelerated form of silicosis. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: equipment + dust, working conditions">Many of the companies specialising in the finishing process of working with this product have a small number of employees and there appears to be an absence of safe working conditions, with no adequate water suppression systems for the dust created, in adequate respiratory personal protection equipment and absent or inadequate ventilatory systems.</span> This is therefore continuing to put the workforce at risk of death due to untreatable lung compromise. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 rd December 2024.

Deceased name: Sheldon Jeans
Coroners name: Rachael Griffin
Coroners Area: Dorset
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | State Custody related deaths
This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | HMPPS | HMP Guys Marsh | Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 2. Minister of State for Prisons, Probation and Reducing Reoffending 3. Governing Governor at HMP Guys Marsh 4. Chief Executive at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Rachael Clare Griffin, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Dorset. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22 nd November 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Sheldon Lawrence Jeans, born on the 24 th October 1990 who was aged 32 years at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest before a jury on the 22 nd July 2025. The medical cause of death was: Ia Idiosyncratic Response to Alcoholic Intoxication and Medicinal Drugs (Pregabalin, Mirtazapine, Dihydrocodeine and Quetiapine) II Partial Postural Asphyxia The conclusion of the Inquest was Misadventure. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On the 13th of November 2022 Sheldon Lawrence Jeans, who was a serving prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of his cell. At the conclusion of the Inquest the jury recorded the following under Section 3 of the Record of Inquest: How Sheldon passed away due to a idiosyncratic response to alcoholic intoxication and medicinal drugs combined with partial postural asphyxia. When This occurred on or about 13th November 2022. Where Sheldon was in Cell 37, A Spur, Mercia Wing, HMP Guys Marsh, Shaftesbury, Dorset when this incident occurred. Circumstances Based on evidence provided, during 12th November 2022 Sheldon was in a heightened mental state. This was brought on by the impending news of his parole hearing, challenges encountered in his relationship and this combined with his known historical mental health conditions. Sheldon acquired access and consumed non-prescribed drugs. He also acquired access and consumed illicitly brewed alcohol ‘Hooch'. Although the levels of these substances on their own would not be fatal, when consumed altogether, they caused a high level of sedation and this combined with Sheldon's body posture resulted in respiratory depression. At no point had it been identified that Sheldon had in his possession or was under the influence of un-prescribed drugs and hooch. This resulted in no additional checks on Sheldon during the night until he was found at 5:10am. Sheldon did not intend to end his life as a consequence of his actions but deliberately consumed these substances. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) There is a lack of national policy, and local guidance at HMP Guys Marsh, to inform staff working in prisons of the dangers of illicitly brewed alcohol, also known as hooch. There is also a lack of policy and guidance to assist those working within the prisoner estate with the management and governance of the access to, and use of, illicitly brewed alcohol. Illicitly brewed alcohol is a common substance across the prisoner estate. Evidence was given at the Inquest that in the month of September 2022, 215.5 litres of illicitly brewed alcohol were seized at HMP Guys Marsh. Evidence was given that Hooch continues to be a common problem in prisons. Illicitly brewed alcohol in prison is a substance made from items which are readily and legitimately available to prisoners. Hooch was described as a very, very dangerous substance during the course of the evidence and as is clear from the cause of his death, was central to the death of Sheldon. Evidence was given that it has sedative effects which if taken with certain medications can increase the sedative effects. Evidence was given that the policies in place concerning the possession and use of illicit substances within the prisoner estate at the time of Sheldon's death, and those in place now, focus on drugs or medication, but are silent in relation to alcohol. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: lack of guidance">I am concerned that this lack of guidance could lead to a future death in prison custody (2) Prisoners can have access to certain medication to hold in their possession which could be accessed by other prisoners and there is a lack of national policy, and local policy at HMP Guys Marsh, from a healthcare and prison perspective, around the governance of medication held in possession in the prison estate.</span> Evidence was heard that when a person is prescribed medication in prison, it can either be taken under supervision, or a prisoner can be provided with the medication to hold in their possession, in their cell. In these cases, the prisoner is responsible for the safety of that medication. Prior to being provided with medication in their possession a risk assessment is undertaken upon the prisoner to assess the risks associated with the drug and also the risks associated with prisoner. Whilst medications defined as controlled drugs would not be given in possession, it is possible to have medication that could cause death in possession. Although Sheldon was not prescribed the medications that caused his death, evidence was given some of those medications are suitable to be prescribed to a prisoner in possession. It is not known how Sheldon accessed the medication found in his system at the time of his death, other than to say he obtained it at HMP Guys Marsh. At HMP Guys Marsh, which may not be the case across the prisoner estate, a lockable cupboard is provided in cells for the storage of medication. Evidence was given that at times cells will be left insecure at HMP Guys Marsh when the prison is in a state of unlock, such as when prisoners collect meals or for example when they go for showers or are out of the cells on association. Evidence was given that prisoners go into each other's cells when they are in a state of unlock. Prisoners could therefore enter another prisoner's cell. If medication is not held securely in a lockable cupboard there is a risk that prisoners who are not prescribed medication, could access medication. Evidence was given at the Inquest that due to the chaotic life some prisoners lead, even when provided with lockable cupboards, cells at HMP Guys Marsh have been seen to contain medication that is not secure and is strewn all over the cell. The medication in Sheldon's cell at the time of his death was found insecure in a Tupperware container. Further, if a medication prescribed to a prisoner is discontinued, evidence was heard that the onus is upon the prisoner returning any excess medication to the healthcare department at HMP Guys Marsh which may be the position in other prisons. The issues around securing of medication held in possession in a cell and the onus being upon prisoners to return unused medication, carries a risk of prisoners accessing unprescribed medication. At the time of Sheldon's death he was not prescribed the medications found in his system and he had in his cell excessive amounts of medication he was prescribed and had previously been prescribed and discontinued. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures

Deceased name: Samantha Young
Coroners name: Henry Charles
Coroners Area: Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton
Category: Suicide (from 2015) | Mental Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Secretary of State for Health 2 Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Henry CHARLES, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 28 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Kate YOUNG aged 49. The inquest was concluded on 5 th June 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a Hanging. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest On 20th November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED]. Sadly, she had intentionally taken her own life by hanging herself with a ligature. The background is that Samantha Young had struggled for a number of years with her mental health. She had, impressively, managed to control an alcohol addiction and had indeed stopped taking alcohol. At the time of her death she was under very great stress following marriage breakdown and relocation. She had attempted suicide before. She was under the care of the CMHT, she had been and continued to access private medical care, which was undoubtedly beneficial. She had received substantial and effective family support. Her condition had deteriorated in early November 2023. It is clear that she had made many attempts - successfully so - to access medical treatment, and statutory service support right to the end whilst battling her mental health issues. She had done all she could to help herself and remain in the life of her daughter. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) A. Assessment of the risk that a patient poses to themselves or others is clearly a cornerstone of the work of an NHS Trust dealing with mental health. At the material time there was a lack of any training as to compilation of risk assessments. I was informed by a senior manager of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust that with the translation of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust into the new Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that issue of training is being addressed. However it emerged at the inquest that there do not appear to be any firm plans to train agency staff. Agency staff form a significant percentage of frontline staff. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: respect">Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review its provision of training for agency staff, in particular in respect of risk assessments.</span> B. Wider family and friends of the deceased perspective were not contacted.. A patient's family and friends are clearly an invaluable resource for learning more about a patient's mental health and specifically risk to life, the support available to the patient and the potential for synergistic support with the NHS Trust. This PFD is not the first time that the issue has been raised with Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust: in 2023 the Senior Coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton issued a PFD on similar grounds arising out of the inquest into the death of Kirsty Taylor. The Senior Coroner observed in the PFD that "I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being sufficiently, effectively and meaningfully listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatment or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions." Moreover, in 2021 a report commissioned by NHS England into Southern Health Foundation Trust similarly reported on shortfall in communication with families. Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review guidelines and procedures concerning communication with family and friends of patients with mental health difficulties by its permanent and agency staff, and monitoring of whether such communication has taken place. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 18, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The family of Samantha Young, Hampshire County Council and [REDACTED] I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 25/07/2025 Henry CHARLES HM Assistant Coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton

Deceased name: Emily Stokes
Coroners name: Catherine Wood
Coroners Area: North East Kent
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | Child Death (from 2015)
This report is being sent to: Kent Central Ambulance Service
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Kent Central Ambulance Service 1 CORONER I am Ms. Catherine Wood, Assistant Coroner for North East Kent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 4 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Emily Rose STOKES. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was Drug related death 1a MDMA Toxicity 1b 1c 1d II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Emily Stokes was 17 years old and a looked after child, having been in foster care since 2012. Since 17 May 2024 she had been living in a semi independent placement in Chingford following the breakdown in her foster care placement in Kent. She had made plans to meet friends at the Worried about Henry music festival at Dreamlands in Margate, Kent on 29 June 2024. Her friends reported that she had taken MDMA possibly shortly before she entered the festival but she was also seen taking a tablet not long after she arrived at the festival. There had been bag and pat down searches undertaken by security staff for all those entering the festival but no drugs were found in any search she underwent as she would not have been allowed entry. She started behaving erratically and assistance was sought and she was taken to the on site medical tent arriving at approximately 15.23 and was distressed and agitated as well as tachycardic and hyperpyrexial. A set of observations recorded at 15.34 showed a respiratory rate of 28, saturations of 94%on air, a blood pressure of 143/119 and a heart rate of 186 with a temperature of 40.6 degrees and a NEWS score of 9. At 15.43 ambulance crew working for providers at the event were radioed and asked to return to the site to take Emily to hospital. They arrived back at the medical tent shortly after 4pm and are seen leaving the medical tent with the private ambulance crew at 16.16 and they left the site at 16.19. During this time Emily remained hyperpyrexial, tachycardic, distressed and confused and no attempts at reducing her temperature were undertaken. No pre alert call was made to the hospital and the journey was made without lights and sirens. The journey time was approximately 5 or 6 minutes so she arrived at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital at approximately 16.25/6. Emily was then assisted back up the stretcher by a paramedic and there was then a delay in her being triaged due to communication issues between the private ambulance staff and the triage nurse. The paramedic who had assisted in moving Emily recognised the severity of Emily's presentation and assisted with getting her moved to the resuscitation area in the emergency department. She was documented as having been seen by a doctor at 16.45 although the timings were written retrospectively and accounts indicated that as she was wheeled into the resuscitation bay the doctor was present. It was recognised that she was critically unwell and cooling measures were instituted and intravenous benzodiazepines given as she was displaying the ill effects of MDMA toxicity and suffering from serotonin syndrome. Intensive care clinicians were called and the team were preparing to intubate her when she suffered a cardiac arrest and despite efforts at resuscitation which lasted more than an hour she was pronounced dead shortly after 6pm. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Private ambulance providers were used and the training of the staff involved was minimal, the evidence heard indicated that they had a qualification called First Response Emergency Care level 4 which was a five day course and had little experience or training in relation to management of patients having taken drugs. Given that the teams on site were present and ambulances available at a music event where the risk of drug taking was deemed to be high more training should have been provided to assist the staff in how to safely manage those under the influence of illicit substances. (2) There was a lack of clarity regarding who had responsibility for making a pre alert call to the hospital and given this young girl was significantly unwell this should have been done. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment">This in part may have been due to the lack of recognition of the seriousness of her symptoms and therefore potentially linked with training of staff. (3)The ambulance did not have the same equipment which an NHS Ambulance would have on board and was in essence very little more than a means of transport from the venue to the hospital and may have given a false sense of reassurance. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Kent Central Ambulance Service have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 July 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Emily's parents, Waltham Forest Council Corporate parent, Sands Heritage Ltd Dreamland, Manchett Security, Integrated Medical Services, South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) and East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust (EKHT)and to the LOCAL SAFEGUARDING BOARD. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 19 May 2025 Signature Catherine Wood Assistant Coroner for North East Kent

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. The Secretary of State for the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 1 CORONER I am Michael James Pemberton, HM Area Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester (West). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 29 April 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Joseph HAYES aged 82. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: dementia">The conclusion of the inquest was Accident, and the medical cause of death was 1a Pneumonitis 1b Aspiration due to ingestion of a chemical substance. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased suffered from Dementia in Alzheimer's disease and was admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital on 16 April 2025 following a previous attendance and discharge due to accidental ingestion of a washing detergent on 15 April 2025.</span> This had occurred when he had made a cup of tea at home and put washing detergent into the cup instead of milk after an apparent confusion. He had vomited following the ingestion and it is likely that he aspirated. On admission, he was discovered to be suffering from suspected pneumonitis which was considered likely to have arisen from aspiration of detergent and stomach acid when vomiting after the accidental ingestion. He received treatment by antibiotics, steroids and analgesia. He experienced atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate remained inadequately controlled despite treatment. He continued to decline, and palliative care was provided. He passed away on 21 April 2025. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the course of evidence it was noted that the plastic bottle like packaging in which the white liquid washing detergent was contained was confused by the deceased as a milk carton. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: dementia">He suffered from dementia and appeared to have poured the liquid into a cup of tea he had made, subsequently placing the detergent container in the fridge. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Safety Culture + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: no safety + dementia">The container had a screw top with no safety features meaning that it would be easily accessible by a person with reduced capacity or dementia, or even a child enabling the contents able to be consumed with apparent ease. 3.</span> Whilst the liquid was deemed to have low toxicity, on the evidence it led to vomiting and aspiration causing damage to the lungs and subsequent breathing difficulties. In this case this was causative of death. 4. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: respect">In my judgment, there is a risk of similar events in respect of the ingestion of a liquid washing detergent because: a.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

The screw top lid with no child or resistance protection is easily accessible. 5. The level of printed warnings on the labelling was not explored during the hearing, but this may not specify that the item could be a risk to vulnerable adults as well as the need to keep out of the reach of children. 6. The public knowledge of these risks is not likely to be at a level where households in which vulnerable adults reside are aware of the need to safeguard detergents and make them less accessible. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

        Date of report: 22/07/2025
Ref: 2025-0370
Deceased name: Robyn Chambers
Coroners name: Caroline Saunders
Coroners Area: Gwent
Category: Child Death (from 2015) | Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards) | Wales prevention of future deaths reports (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: Aneurin Bevan University Health Board
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board 1 CORONER I am Caroline Saunders, Senior Coroner for the Area of Gwent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under Paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST On 18/11/2024 an investigation was opened touching upon the death of Robyn Anne Chambers The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11/7/2025 The conclusion of the inquest was recorded as Natural Causes The medical cause of death was: 1a) Lower Respiratory Tract Infection 1b) Chronic Lung Disease 1c) Extreme Prematurity. Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy. Epilepsy and Global Developmental delay. 2. Previous Duodenal Perforation. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Robyn Anne Chambers sustained hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy when she was born prematurely at 23 weeks gestation. This led to significant physical and neurological problems, including ongoing respiratory problems. On 26/10/2024, Robyn developed a chest infection. Despite intensive treatment, the effects were overwhelming and resulted in Robyn's death on 2/11/2024 at Ty Hafan Hospice in Sully. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - Following Robyn's traumatic birth she was cared for at home by her parents. Robyn needed extensive medical intervention and monitoring at home. When she became unwell on 26/10/2024 her parents called an ambulance and were informed that it would take about 8 hours for an Amber 1 ambulance to respond. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment">Robyn's parents decided to take Robyn to hospital themselves which was a difficult and potentially dangerous journey because Robyn had complicated medical equipment that needed to remain attached.</span> The estimated length of time for an ambulance to be dispatched and the decision taken by Robyn's parents to convey her to hospital had no impact on Robyn's care and did not affect the outcome. However, having heard evidence from Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, I note that the main reason for the delay in dispatching emergency ambulances remains the length of time it is taking for ambulances to be released from the emergency department of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board hospitals, predominantly the Grange University Hospital. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance was delayed">Evidence provided at inquest indicated that, at the time that Robyn's parents called for an ambulance, the longest time an ambulance was delayed at the GUH was in excess of 10 hours. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.</span> I am concerned that despite previous assurances that action was being taken by ABUHB and WAST in relation to managing ambulance delays (which I appreciate can be multi-factorial) a significant problem remains in relation to the release of ambulances from the GUH Emergency Department. The handover times are far exceeding the 15-minute handover time agreed between these 2 organisations. Patients' lives are being, and will continue to be, put at risk if this situation is not resolved. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 16 September 2025. I, the Coroner, may extend this period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is necessary 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following Interested Person (s) The family of Robyn Chambers I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 DATE 22/7/25 Signed Caroline Saunders His Majesty's Senior Coroner for Gwent.

Ref: 2025-0369
Deceased name: Christopher O'Donnell
Coroners name: Ian Singleton
Coroners Area: Wiltshire and Swindon
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths
This report is being sent to: Home Group Limited
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive/Managing Director Home Group Limited One Strawberry Lane Newcastle-upon-Tyne Tyne & Wear NE1 4BX 1 CORONER I am Ian Singleton, Area Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 14 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher John O'Donnell and I opened an Inquest into his death on 30 September 2024. On 18 July 2025 I concluded Christopher's Inquest. I found the medical cause of death was as follows: 1a. Asphyxia due to Airway Obstruction by Vomit 1b. Drug Toxicity By way of a conclusion, I recorded a short form conclusion of drug related and as to when where and how (by what means Christopher came by his death) I provided the following: Christopher John O'Donnell (Chris) lived in supported living accommodation at Canal House, [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">Chris had a past medical history which included drug and alcohol abuse, together with mental health issues, for which he had been prescribed medication.</span> In November 2023, Chris admitted that he had not taken his medication for some months, leading to a noticeable return of his paranoia and persecution complex, resulting in Chris believing wrongly, that it was not safe for him to remain at Canal House., but he had no alternative accommodation to go to. On the 12 December 2023, Chris was found deceased in a communal lounge at Canal House, having consumed a substantial, but not fatal amount of his methadone medication, that he had been allowed access to, notwithstanding the recognised risks, which had led to him vomiting and being asphyxiated by his airway being obstructed by vomit. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Having considered the evidence, I found the following facts in relation to the circumstances of Chris' death. Chris' death was drug related in that the post-mortem confirmed that he had taken a substantial, but not necessarily fatal amount of his prescribed Methadone that led to his central nervous systems including breathing and heart rate being slowed down. Common side effects are nausea and vomiting with the vomit being aspirated causing obstruction of Chris' airway leading to asphyxia and death. I found that the following factors more than minimally contributed to his decision to take that medication. Firstly, that Christopher had suffered for a number of years with drug and alcohol abuse and with his mental health, for which he had been prescribed medication. Christopher had stated that he had stopped taking the medication leading to a return of paranoia and a persecution complex leading to Chris believing it was not safe for him to live at Canal House [REDACTED] but Chris did not have any alternative accommodation to go to on 12 December 2023. Secondly, that Chis had a stockpile of Methadone in his room which he had access to as from 11 December 2023 and consumed one half of, leading to the sequence of events that caused his death, despite the risk of that stockpile, being recognised beforehand. During the course of the Inquest, I heard evidence from [REDACTED] a Mental Health Support Worker at Canal House that she had had a discussion with [REDACTED] Christopher's Recovery Co-Ordinator with the local Substance Misuse Team, that Chris had a stockpile of Methadone medication in his room and that she was concerned at the risk that it posed. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: pharmacy">In evidence [REDACTED] said that she had spoken to Christopher about agreeing to giving up the medication and returning it to a pharmacy but as he had not consented, that had not happened.</span> She also believed that she had raised it with her manager, but the view was, that as Christopher had not consented to the medication being confiscated there was nothing they could do. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The issue that I had was that there appeared to be no basis for or consideration of the supported living accommodation provider, taking action to provide safeguarding for Christopher by removing the excess medication so that it was not within his control. I was informed by [REDACTED] that the supported living accommodation provider did not allow staff to hold any medication even if it was done with the intention of providing safeguarding to someone, who by all accounts, was undergoing a mental health crisis. I would hope that the organisation will review its policies as to what action (if any) it can take when it is made aware of a risk to a resident, rather than to only take action with the resident's consent. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Person, Family of Mr O'Donnell I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person whom she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated 21 July 2025 Signature: Ian Singleton HM Area Coroner for Wiltshire & Swindon

Ref: 2025-0367
Deceased name: Melissa Mathieson
Coroners name: M. E. Voisin
Coroners Area: Avon
Category: Care Home Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: Alexandra Homes Ltd
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Alexandra Homes Ltd 1 CORONER I am M. E. Voisin HM Senior Coroner for Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 7 th January 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Melissa Louise Mathieson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 th July 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury associated with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with features highly suggestive of neck compression The conclusion of the inquest was a short form with a narrative which read as follows: "Melissa died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care. The home failed Melissa in numerous ways: the resident who went on to strangle her should not have been placed in the same facility as Melissa, at all, based on his known risks. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: trained">The decision was wrongly made to place him in the same facility with an ineffective care plan and risk assessment, with staff that were not trained on his level of risk, and managers who failed to act when concerns were highlighted by staff and Melissa.</span> In addition, the placing authority knowing this residents risks should not have agreed the care plan and package being offered, furthermore they also failed to act when concerns were raised. With this resident's known risks he should not have been offered a placement at the home and the catalogue of failures resulting in his placement with no effective risk assessment in place resulted in the death of Melissa. " 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Melissa was autistic, suffered with ADHD and had a diagnosis of Asperger's, she was 18yrs old and was vulnerable. She became a resident of Alexandra Homes in August 2014 along with another resident, called [REDACTED], who went on to murder her on 12 th October 2014. [REDACTED] had undergone an assessment with a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, [REDACTED], who formed the opinion that he presented with a significantly high risk of future violence towards others, his violence also includes sexually harmful behaviour towards others including strangulation, the frequency and imminence of violence is also high, she said, that he should be supervised at all times. [REDACTED] had said that he wanted to kill somebody and have sex with their dead body. [REDACTED] was moving from a school where he had been supervised 24 hours a day on a 2:1 basis during the day and 1.5:1 at night. When at Alexandra Homes his care plan stated 1:1 but was not 24hrs a day and was not 1:1 care at all, in that at night there were 16 residents to 1 support staff and during the day he was allocated a support worker to do activities, but he could wonder around the home on his own unsupervised. Support workers, staff and Melissa raised concerns about [REDACTED]'s behaviour generally and specifically that Melissa was frightened of him. On 12 th October at about 11.40pm, [REDACTED] and Melissa had already gone to their bedrooms, [REDACTED] was unsupervised, when staff heard a loud bang. One of them said ..." I ran up the stairs and opened the fire door, Melissa was on her back, her legs were slightly skew whiff. Her head was slightly to one side facing the stairs, I could see one eye which was open and there was a cut above it, I could see marks around her neck which were very red. She was fully clothed and she appeared dead..." Melissa was taken to the local hospital but died a few days later from her injuries. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) the offer of placement and the level of supervision i.e. 1:1 was misleading, there was no clarification for example, 24hrs cover, 8hrs cover during the day only, or when carrying out activities or when outside the home only. (2) there was no formal induction period set for residents with formal weekly reviews (3) there was no formal review of the support plan and risk assessment especially during the induction period. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Alexandra Homes Ltd have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 th September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the chief coroner and to the following interested persons [REDACTED] States of Guernsey Higford School I am also under a duty to send the chief coroner a copy of your response. The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the chief coroner. 9 Signature M. E.

Deceased name: Patryk Gladysz
Coroners name: Priya Malhotra
Coroners Area: Inner West London
Category: State Custody related deaths | Mental Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: HMPPS | Minister of State for Prisons | Ministry of Justice/HMP Wandsworth | Secretary of State for Health and Social Care | Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. HMPPS 2. Minister of State for Prisons 3. Ministry of Justice/HMP Wandsworth 4. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 5. Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Priya Malhotra, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Inner West London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 February 2024 an inquest opened into the death of Patryk Gladysz, aged 27 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2025. The conclusion of the jury was that the deceased hung himself with a ligature. His intentions in doing so remain unknown. It is likely that the following factors are likely to have possibly contributed, in a more than minimal way to Patryk's death: 1. There was no in-depth psychological assessment of Patryk. 2. There were low staffing levels in the prison and the in-reach healthcare teams. 3. There was a lack of clear inter-departmental communication. 4. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: lack of knowledge">There was a lack of knowledge of Patryk's history and personal circumstances and inconsistent familiarity of related policies and procedures. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Patryk had a diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2019.</span> He was under the care of his community mental health team, with regular contact with his care co-ordinator and received a fortnightly anti-psychotic depot injection. On 17 April 2023 Patryk arrived at HMP Wandsworth awaiting extradition to Poland. It was noted he required an interpreter and had limited English in his Prison Escort Record and NOMIS, although this was subsequently inconsistently recorded. He claimed asylum on 26 April 2023 preventing his extradition. Patryk was under the care of the in-reach mental health team (Oxleas) within HMP Wandsworth. He received a fortnightly depot injection, which was missed on 23 November 2023. He next received his injection on 14 December 2023 - 5 weeks later. On 14 December 2023 he first reported hearing voices. Until the time of his death, Patryk had not been seen by a psychiatrist. An assessment and risk assessment of Patryk took place on 20 and 27 October 2023 - evidence before the jury was that it should have been completed within 5 days of Patryk being case loaded to the mental health in-reach team; this was in April 2023 - the assessment was approximately 6 months late. An official interpreter was not used for the assessments, which lasted 15- 20 minutes. The jury heard mental health in-reach team staff were understaffed at the time, which impacted their ability to undertake meaningful mental health assessments and that staff who administered his depot injection did not know he previously attempted to ligature in the community. He was not allocated a key worker and HMP Wandsworth adopted a qualified key worker scheme. There was no entry on Patryk's NOMIS confirming there was any meaningful interaction with him between 22 May 2023 and 5 January 2024. Patryk had two interactions with Catch22, the last interaction was on 22 May 2023. There was inconsistency in staff knowledge of whether health care staff had access to the NOMIS. Senior Prison officers demonstrated a lack of awareness of policy documents concerning the heightened risk of foreign national prisoners. On 5 January 2024 at 09:08 Patryk was found in his cell with a ligature around his neck. A return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, and he was taken to St George's Hospital at 10:46. A CT scan showed complete loss of grey white matter differentiation and Patryk's death was confirmed on 19 January 2025 at St George's Hospital. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments. (2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Patryk's next of kin. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Priya Malhotra 18 July 2025

This report is being sent to: National Highways Agency
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: National Highways Agency 1 CORONER I am Jacques Howell, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Hertfordshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 5 May 2024 inquests were opened into the deaths of Darren Christopher Reilly, aged 55, and, Tyler Cox, aged 18. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: respect">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquests on 9 July 2025 in respect of Mr Reilly, and 11 July 2025 in respect of Miss Cox.</span> The inquests found that Mr Reilly died as a result of multiple traumatic injures, and Miss Cox died as a result of a traumatic head injury. The conclusion of both inquests was that both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox died in a Road Traffic Collision. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 1 April 2024, Mr Reilly was driving a Range Rover in company with this partner and her three children, one of whom was Miss Cox. They were driving along the M1 southbound, when approximately 1 mile before the exit slip road for junction 5 for Watford, Mr Reilly lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle leaving the carriageway to the nearside, through a gap in the safety barrier that runs along the nearside of the M1 and colliding with trees. As a result of the collision both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox sustained fatal traumatic injuries, and their deaths were confirmed at the scene. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - I heard evidence that along this section of the M1 southbound there are safety barriers to the nearside of the carriageway. It was explained to me that if a vehicle loses control, the safety barrier is designed to prevent a vehicle from leaving the carriageway - the idea being that a vehicle that has lost control will continue along the safety barrier before coming to a more controlled stop, thereby minimising the risk of serious injury of death to passengers. It was further explained to me that this is particularly important when a high-speed carriageway (such as a motorway) is lined with established trees, as is the case here. This is because any vehicle that has lost control and leaves the carriageway is likely to do so at high speed and collide with these established trees. This would likely lead to a very sharp and sudden deceleration, and may cause the vehicle to overturn, which significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury and death to passengers. In this case, I was shown images of the collision scene which depict the presence of safety barriers shortly before and shortly after the collision site. Whilst I heard evidence that, in general, gaps are sometimes inserted into the safety barrier for the purposes of access or due to the presence of other safety measures (e.g. a grassed bank), the witnesses from the Roads Policing Unit could not offer any explanation for why there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location. Consequently, I am concerned that there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location, which for the reasons outlined above gives rise to a risk that future deaths may occur. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. The family of Mr Reilly 2. The family of Miss Cox I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 18 July 2025 Mr. Jacques Howell Area Coroner - Hertfordshire

        Date of report: 18/01/2024
Ref: 2025-0360
Deceased name: Leonard Moaven
Coroners name: Mary Hassell
Coroners Area: Inner North London
Category: Suicide (from 2015) | Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: London Fire Brigade
Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Commissioner London Fire Brigade 169 Union Street London SE1 0LL 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 August 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Leonard Moaven, aged 61 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 January 2024. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide. Dr Moaven jumped from the roof of his block of flats at 5.33pm on 26 July 2023. He had got onto the roof by using a ladder to reach his attic and, when he got there, punching a hole through the roof tiles. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Before he jumped off the roof, Dr Moaven called the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), who in turn called the London Fire Brigade (LFB). When police officers tried to negotiate with him, Dr Moaven appeared receptive to the idea of coming down off the roof safely. Police officers were reluctant to suggest that he return the way he had come, as by now it was raining and they were concerned that he would slip, and so he waited on the roof for firefighters to escort him. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. Dr Moaven rang police at 4.33pm, exactly one hour before he actually jumped off the roof. Police attended immediately and sought firefighter assistance immediately. However, they reported to me at inquest that there was some delay in the attendance of LFB. 2. Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance. This had to travel from further afield and Dr Moaven became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 5.33pm when he jumped. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: respect">The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.</span> I did not take evidence from any firefighters at inquest, and so I appreciate that there may be elements of which I am unaware. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 March 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. 1. [REDACTED], wife of Leonard Moaven 2. [REDACTED], sister of Leonard Moaven 3. HHJ Thomas Teague QC, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 DATE 18.01.24 SIGNED BY SENIOR CORONER ME Hassell

Deceased name: Doreen Swann
Coroners name: Alison Mutch

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: The Department of Health and Social Care | Greater Manchester Integrated Care
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1) The Department of Health and Social Care 2) Greater Manchester Integrated Care 1 CORONER I am Alison Mutch, senior coroner, for the coroner area of South Manchester 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 16th January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Doreen Swann. The investigation concluded on the 5 th June 2025 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of a fall when not being cared for in compliance with her risk assessment . <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: dementia">The medical cause of death was 1a) Traumatic brain injury 1b) Fall II) Advanced dementia, frailty, E. coli septicaemia, bronchopneumonia. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Doreen Swann was a patient at Tameside General Hospital who had been medically optimised and was awaiting discharged when she developed a further infection.</span> She was a high falls risk. She fell whilst unobserved and when the bed rails were up when they should not have been. She suffered a traumatic brain injury and died at Tameside General Hospital on 13th January 2025. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The inquest heard evidence that Doreen Swann was only in hospital at the point of her fall because her discharge had been delayed due to a shortage of a suitable social care placement. The evidence was that nursing/caring for high falls risk patients in an acute setting is challenging and resource intensive. The evidence given to the inquest was that this delayed discharge and the ongoing risk it presents was not an isolated incident at TGH -as an example the evidence given was that there were regularly 30 plus patients with a delayed discharge over 3 weeks due to a lack of social care beds .The evidence indicated that this challenge was not unique to Tameside. The evidence indicated that managing a falls risk and the consequential risk to life is better managed outside an acute setting once the clinical need for a hospital stay has passed. Delayed discharges such as Doreen Swann's reduces the availability of beds for other patients and creates a knock-on impact across the hospital particularly in relation to the Emergency Department. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 th September 2025 . I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons namely the family and Tameside General Hospital,who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Alison Mutch HMC Senior Coroner 10/07/2025

Deceased name: Noreen McGlynn
Coroners name: Mary Hassell
Coroners Area: Inner North London
Category: Community health care and emergency services related deaths
This report is being sent to: Mountfield Surgery | Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust
Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Senior Partner Mountfield Surgery 55 Mountfield Road Finchley London N3 3NR 2. Chief Executive Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust Ground Floor 15 Marylebone Road London NW1 5JD 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Poplar Coroner's Court Bow Coroner's Court 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 5 February 2025, one of my assistant coroners, Ian Potter, commenced an investigation into the death of Noreen McGlynn aged 89 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a determination of death by natural causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Noreen McGlynn developed a throat infection and a urinary tract infection at home and was prescribed amoxicillin by her general practitioner. She suffered an anaphylactic reaction to this and was admitted to hospital. The reaction was reversed, but she died three days later from her underlying conditions. I recorded her medical cause of death as: 1a aspiration pneumonia 1b cerebrovascular disease and frailty of old age 2 anaphylaxis to penicillin. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that, even before her anaphylaxis Ms McGlynn was waiting for an ambulance to take her to hospital. This was on the advice of two GPs and with the agreement of her daughter. However, Noreen McGlynn's family did not want her to go to hospital. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: elderly">They believed that she had a better chance of remaining well out of hospital. (The challenges that hospital admission present to the elderly are very well recognised.) And if she were now dying, family knew that Ms McGlynn would want to die at home.</span> Her living situation was very supportive. She was a widow but she had an excellent full time carer and a loving, extremely engaged family, with her daughter living near by. The reason that family now favoured hospital admission was because Ms McGlynn had become so dehydrated. They recognised that this was life threatening and likely to make her feel unwell. If the rapid response team from the Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust who visited, or the GPs from Mountfield Surgery, had been able to offer rehydration at home, this would have been a far preferable course of action for Noreen McGlynn and for her loved ones. Could such rehydration at home have been offered? Could it be offered to others in the future? 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. The daughter and son of Noreen McGlynn [REDACTED], Royal Free Hospital Royal College of General Practitioners Care Quality Commission for England Chief Medical Officer for England HHJ Alexia Durran, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 DATE 11.07.25 SIGNED BY SENIOR CORONER ME Hassell

Deceased name: Patricia Heaviside
Coroners name: Rebecca Sutton
Coroners Area: County Durham and Darlington
Category: Care Home Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: Williams and Spenceley Limited | Howlish Hall Care Home | CQC | Durham County Council
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], as Sole Director and 75%+ shareholder of Williams and Spenceley Ltd (the company that owns Howlish Hall Care Home), 29 Finkle Street, Bishop Auckland, DL14 7PL 2. Manager of Howlish Hall Care Home ([REDACTED]). 3.CQC 4. Head of the AHS Practice Improvement Team, Durham County Council 1 CORONER I am Rebecca Sutton, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of County Durham and Darlington. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. [HYPERLINKS] 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 30 December 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Patricia Heaviside, 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that the Deceased died on 26 December 2024 as a consequence of a fall that occurred on 4 October 2024 at Howlish Hall Care Home. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The Deceased had been a resident of Howlish Hall Care Home since February 2023. During her time at Howlish Hall the Deceased suffered a number of falls. In or about August 2023 the home manager received advice from the Community Falls Service, who recommended that a sensor box be placed in the Deceased's bedroom and that the Deceased should use hip protectors, which could be purchased by the Deceased's family. The home did not follow these recommendations and did not inform the family of the option to purchase hip protectors. Following the family reporting concerns to social services, a social worker attended at the home on 27 September 2024. The home staff assured the social worker that they had a sensor mat that they would place next to the Deceased's bed, but this was not done. On 4 October 2024 the Deceased suffered an unwitnessed fall in her room and sustained a fractured left hip. She underwent surgery to fix the fracture on 6 October 2024. She was discharged back to the home on 11 October 2024. Due to ongoing family concerns the Deceased was moved to a different care home on 3 December 2024. Her condition deteriorated and she died as a consequence of the hip fracture on 26 December 2024. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) Despite recommendations for falls prevention equipment being made by the Community Falls Service in August 2023, no falls prevention equipment was put in place by the time of the Deceased's fall in October 2024 (2) Despite the social worker expressing concern about the lack of falls prevention equipment on 27 September 2024, no falls equipment was put in place prior to the Deceased's fall on 4 October 2024. (3) Information about the Community Falls Service recommendations was not passed on to the family, or to social services. (4) On 5 August 2024 (following a fall, but before the more significant fall on 4 October 2024), the Deceased's family were told by the Deputy Manager of Howlish Hall that the owner of Howlish Hall "probably wouldn't want to pay for a sensor mat". (5) I received evidence that, subsequent to the Deceased's death, there had been a reluctance on the part of [REDACTED] (who was believed to be the owner of Howlish Hall Care Home) to provide adequate resources for falls prevention equipment. (6) Despite it being recognised that the Deceased lacked mental capacity to make decisions about where she lived and was unable to keep herself safe, it appears that the home did not make any application for a DoLS assessment for the Deceased.</span> Indeed I received evidence that when a new home manager was appointed at Howlish Hall in January 2025 none of the residents were subject to a DoLS, despite a large number of the residents lacking mental capacity. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].

He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Rebecca Sutton HMAC County Durham and Darlington 10.07.25

Ref: 2025-0351
Deceased name: Gemma Poterajko
Coroners name: Elizabeth Didcock
Coroners Area: Nottinghamshire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Dr Elizabeth Didcock, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Nottinghamshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23.8.24, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Gemma Louise Poterajko The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 27 th June 2025 The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows: Gemma died from a rare, unexpected, but recognised complication of a pacemaker lead extraction. She died from multi organ failure caused by catastrophic haemorrhage from two venous tears in the left innominate vein and left subclavian vein, sustained during the lead extraction. No identified issues of care have, on balance, caused or made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to her death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Gemma died on 22.8.24 at the City Hospital in Nottingham following a pacemaker Lead Extraction procedure. During the advancement of the Tightrail cutting sheath used to cut through fibrous scar tissue surrounding the lead, to aid lead extraction, the cutting blades likely caused two tears in the wall of the left subclavian and left innominate veins. These tears occurred at sometime between 14.35 and Gemma's collapse with low blood pressure at 14.48 hours on that day. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: mechanism + mechanism">Whilst the exact mechanism of venous tearing is unclear, and is a very unusual occurrence, the vein walls were likely to be additionally vulnerable because of the stuck fibrous tissue around the pacemaker lead also being stuck to the vein inner wall.</span> No evidence of careless or incorrect technique has been established to have led to these tears. Bleeding from these tears was catastrophic, likely the most significant bleed being from the higher tear in the subclavian vein, where the Tightrail sheath was found protruding from the vein at 16.55 hours. The first venous tear was found at 16.11.hours. Managing events from 14.48 onwards was challenging for the team of senior clinicians present, as there was a need to search for and potentially deal with, a more common bleeding site, that is from the Right Atrium or from a Superior Vena Cava tear, before a higher venous tear was considered. Rendering all appropriate resuscitative measures, including cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary before further bleeding sites were searched for, as Gemma had such a profound circulatory collapse with a cardiac arrest at 15.00 hours requiring ongoing cardiac compressions and full and continuing advanced life support. The extent of bleeding from the venous tears was likely unsurvivable once it had occurred, although it was entirely appropriate to continue all measures to try and save Gemma's life up until sadly the situation was futile with evidence of established multi organ failure later that evening. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The lack of a formalised documented system of risk stratification for Lead extraction. The consequence is that there is a lack of clear planning for what may be needed from the cardiac surgical team, in terms of urgent surgical expertise, theatre staff support and perfusion team support, for any given lead extraction 2. The lack of a written Trust Standard Operating Procedure for Lead extraction that includes a record of the planning discussion, and sets out realistic cardiac surgical involvement when this is necessary 3. The lack of clarity as to how the full cardiac surgical team can within their resources currently, or planned for, provide necessary attendance in a timely way at a given Lead extraction procedure, as per international expert consensus I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4 th September 2025. I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The family I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 10 th July 2025 Dr E. A. Didcock

Ref: 2025-0349
Deceased name: Jairus Earl
Coroners name: Rachael Griffin
Coroners Area: Dorset
Category: Child Death (from 2015) | Suicide (from 2015)
This report is being sent to: Home Office | Department of Health and Social Care
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Secretary of State for the Home Department 2. Secretary of State for Health 1 CORONER I am Rachael Clare Griffin, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Dorset. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 16 th April 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Jairus Joshua Timothy Earl, born on the 8 th June 2008, who was aged 15 years at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 1 st July 2025. The medical cause of death was: Ia Fatal shotgun injury to the head The conclusion of the Inquest was suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jairus was 15 years old when he died on the 14 th April 2024. He had a history of mental ill health and had been under the care of his General Practitioner, a Chartered Psychologist and a Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He had disclosed to them thoughts of ending his life and although he had no plans to do so, he had talked about methods of doing this which included shooting. His father, who Jairus resided with, was a shotgun licence holder. Jairus enjoyed outdoor life and would go out with his father and other family members shooting. The family resided in London, which is where the shotgun licence was held, however they had another home in Dorset. At the end of March 2024, the family travelled to Dorset to spend some time together at their home in Dorset. They took with them a number of shotguns which were then placed in a secure cabinet at the home address in Dorset. Dorset Police were not advised of the location of these guns in the Dorset area as there is no current legal requirement to notify the force where additional places of residence may be. On the 14 th April 2024 Jairus and his father were due to return to their home in London and were closing down the property. Jairius' father was in the process of packing the guns into his car to transport them to London when Jairus went into the office at the property where he used one of the shotguns to end his life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation the evidence provided revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) I have concerns in relation to gaps in the regulation of shotgun licences especially when a licence holder has more than one property where the guns may be used or stored. The Firearms Act 1968 (The Act) is the primary legislation that governs the possession and handing of firearms. This is supported by statutory guidance, Firearms Licensing: Statutory Guidance for Chief Officers of Police and non statutory Home Office guidance, Guide on firearms Licensing Law . Section 2 of the Act deals with the requirement of certificate for possession of shotguns. Evidence was given at the Inquest by Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] of Dorset Police who works within the Dorset Firearms and Explosive Licensing Unit and also works with the College of Policing and the national Firearms & Explosive Licencing Working Group to review and update the Home Office statutory guidance and support the national training effort in response to the Prevention of Future Deaths report from the Inquest touching upon the deaths in Keyham on 12 th August 2021. He gave evidence that the regulation for shotguns is different to the regulations for firearms which is governed by Section 1 of The Act. There seems to be a great deal of difference in the regulation of firearms and the regulation of shotguns, however both can equally cause death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Supervision and Leadership
Keywords: lack of regulation">I am concerned that the lack of regulation around shotguns could lead to future deaths.</span> For example, he explained that there is no obligation on a licence holder of a shotgun licence to notify the approving force they are moving to or visiting another property In his written evidence to the Court, which was further expanded on orally at the Inquest, he explained: "Under section 26B(1) of the 1968 Act, an application for the grant of a shotgun shall be made to the chief officer of police where the applicant resides, there is nothing within the firearms act to define a residence or when applicants have properties in different force areas, the non-statutory guide tells me that where an applicant has a residences in different force areas, it is for the individual to decide which force issues their certificate. Shotgun certificates are issued by individual forces' and will display the force crest and signature of the chief officer of the issuing force, however they are valid throughout England and Wales, and allows the holder to travel with their shotguns anywhere in the United Kingdom. ... Shotgun certificates differ from firearm certificates in a number of ways, for firearms, possession of each and every gun must satisfy individual good reason, whereas a good reason for a shotgun is a collective term, and more relaxed, for example a request for a firearms certificate for target shooting will require that the applicant is a member of a Home Office approved club and shoots regularly, whereas a mere intention to undertake clay pigeon shooting would satisfy good reason for a shotgun certificate. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: respect">A shotgun certificate also will also authorise a person to have in their possession, purchase or acquire and unlimited number of shotguns without the need for approval in respect of individual guns, that is to say that so long as the shotguns are stored securely a person may have as many as they want.</span> Another nuance of the shotgun certificate is the '72-hour rule' that it will allow a certificate holder to borrow a shotgun for up to 72 hours without the need to have to record the shotgun on the certificate or notify the police of the transfer. ... Section 28(2)(a) of the 1968 Act provides that a shotgun certificate is granted subject to any prescribed conditions, and no others, that is that these conditions must be applied to the certificate, but the chief officer cannot add additional conditions. .... There is no onus on an applicant to notify another force area where they hold a certificate and have another address in that force area, this is only the case if the certificate holder changes their permanent address that this would be captured by the third condition. There is also no obligation on a certificate holder to notify a chief officer of police when they intent to visit another force area in possession of their shotguns. Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] explained that on the Tuesday following Jairus' death he briefed the national coordinator from the Firearms & Explosive Licencing Working Group to raise matters arising from the circumstances of Jairus' death so there is awareness of the issues relating to second homes, however, there is no legal requirement for second homes to be declared by licence holders. He further told the Court that in 2015, HM Inspection of Firearms Licencing recommended that forces must have a notification system on their local records to identify addresses and people where firearms are held. He explained that these systems are local rather than national and his recommendation to the Firearms & Explosive Licencing Working Group following Jairus's death was that where an applicant declares a second home, the force where that home is located should be notified. Dorset Police have taken action and put a system in place that when they are notified of the above, they will create a record on their system to flag the address as if that were a Dorset certificate holder, however it is not a legal requirement for forces to do this, and it is unknown if other forces nationally are doing this. I therefore have concerns there is a lack of a system of sharing and flagging information between Police forces regarding shotgun licence holders and the location of shotguns, which could lead to future deaths. Accordingly, emergency services may attend an address where shotguns are held without knowledge of that fact due to the lack of a marker being placed on the address. This causes a risk to all those attending unmarked addresses as they would potentially be ill prepared for what they could face which could lead to future deaths. Additionally failing to have such markers on additional homes means that if the police are called to the address for other reasons such as a concern for welfare, they may miss the opportunity to put in place additional security measures ,or even revoke the licence, as required for the safety of the occupants at the address, and others. Evidence was heard that Dorset Police were called to Jairus's family address in Dorset on the 28 th March 2024 following a report that Jairus was missing. It was not apparent from the Police system at the time that there would be shotguns at the address. Jairus's mental health was discussed during the report of this incident. Had the flag system been in place then, consideration could have been given to the continued possession of the shotgun in a property where Jairus could access them. (2) Further I have a concern around the access that police forces have to medical information about other persons living at the same property as the applicant, or at their second homes, when considering firearm and shotgun licence applications. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

Deceased name: Shaun Marriott
Coroners name: Joanne Andrews
Coroners Area: West Sussex, Brighton and Hove
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Joanne ANDREWS, Area Coroner for the coroner area of West Sussex, Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST Mr Marriott elected to undergo a haemorrhoidal artery ligation with mucopexy surgery following consultations with his surgeon. He underwent a pre-assessment for the surgery on 30 March 2024 which was conduced by telephone using the assessment on the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Cerner system. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">During the assessment he was asked about his family medical history and his own history of haematological conditions.</span> He was not asked about his family history of haematological conditions directly as this is not required by the system. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The evidence to the Court was that the clinicians relied upon the patient's response to their family medical history question to ascertain this.</span> The evidence was that Mr Marriott was aware of his significant family history of blood clotting disorders. The evidence from clinicians who assessed him was that this was not disclosed to them. The family believe that he did make this known but there is no evidence which indicates when, where or to whom this was made. The evidence was that he had not been directly asked about this and it was not stated on his notes or GP documentation. On 12 April 2025 he underwent the haemorrhoidal artery ligation with mucopexy surgery as a day patient. He was given compression stockings as per the Trust guidance as well as mechanical calf compression during the procedure which was above what the guidance required. On 15 April 2024 he sadly died at home. A post mortem found he died due to a Pulmonary embolism which on the evidence was a result of the surgery. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence was that the system which is used for assessment of patients prior to day surgery does not (a) directly require a question to be asked about their haematological family history or (b) record negative answers to the questions related to the patient's own haematolgical history 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 4, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The family of Mr Marriott I have also sent it to Moatfield Surgery who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 09/07/2025 Joanne ANDREWS Area Coroner for West Sussex, Brighton and Hove

Deceased name: Peter Ramsden

This report is being sent to: Home Office
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Secretary of State for the Home Department - [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Professor Paul Marks, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of City of Kingston Upon Hull and the County of the East Riding of Yorkshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 st March 2025, I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Ramsden, aged 74 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 th June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was: NATURAL CAUSES 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Peter Ramsden had a past medical history of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidaemia, poor mobility and chronic alcohol excess.</span> He had not been seen for approximately two months by his neighbours who became concerned about his welfare. Entry to his unlocked premises took place on 2nd January 2025 where he was found deceased and in an advanced state of decomposition. There were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding his death. Whilst no named specific disease process can be identified to account for his death, on balance, it was due to a natural disease process. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Evidence was heard that there is a lacuna in the law, specifically relating to section 17 of the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) which grants police officers the power to enter and search premises without a warrant in specific situations. These include, inter alia, entry for arrest and emergency situations which allows entry to save life or limb or prevent serious damage to a property. In this particular case, evidence was heard that this man had not been seen for two months and there were concerns about his welfare and paramedics attended on one occasion but have no powers of entry. Due to the Right Care, Right Person model, which has been developed over the last few years, the police did not get involved, as it was thought by the concerned individual that this man not being seen was due to a medical problem. Evidence was heard which suggested that on occasions, the ambulance service and the fire service should have powers of entry in the event that a person who is ill, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, with a remediable disorder, can receive prompt and potentially life-saving treatment. In this case, causation would not have been established as the man has been dead for several weeks, but situations could and will arise where time-sensitive pathological processes require emergency treatment to save life. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation has the power to take such action, possibly by considering enhanced powers for the emergency services to enter premises in such circumstances. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 nd September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED], Chief Executive Yorkshire Ambulance Service; [REDACTED] Chief Executive Humberside Fire & Rescue; [REDACTED] Chief Constable of Humberside [REDACTED] Chief Executive UK Ambulance Service . I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 8 th July 2025

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED], Chief Constable Greater Manchester Police Divisional Headquarters Building Northampton Road Manchester M40 5BQ 2 [REDACTED], Chief Constable College Of Policing Leamington Road Ryton-on-Dunsmore Coventry CV8 3EN 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy William Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 31 March 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Elaine TARBUCK aged 69. The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 25 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The medical cause of death was: 1a) Exsanguination 1b) Scalp Laceration 2) Ischaemic Heart Disease I returned a narrative conclusion that Elaine Tarbuck died as the consequence of injuries sustained in an accidental fall and the exacerbating effects of pre-existing naturally occurring disease on a background of sub-optimal emergency response. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a medical history that included Multiple Myeloma with reducing mobility, a history of falls (previous pelvic fracture in November 2024) and low mood, depression and anxiety following the recent death of her husband.</span> Such was the nature extent of concern for welfare, her next-of-kin (who resided a long distance from the deceased) would telephone the deceased several times in the day and had also arranged for family friends to visit daily. She was last spoken to during the evening of the 28th of March 2025. At about 9.40am on the morning of 29th of March 2025, a friend of the deceased attended at her residence at [REDACTED], Westhoughton on a pre-arranged welfare visit. Upon obtaining no response from the deceased, he went to the nearest police station to report his concerns. Little Hulton Police Station was unmanned and closed, but public signage giving advice resulted in a call to the police ‘101' non-emergency contact line. The concerned friend was instructed that the matter was a welfare and not a policing matter. At 11.52am having confirmed from family and neighbours that the deceased had not been seen and was still not responding to telephone calls to her, the emergency services were contacted via a ‘999' call. Call handlers determined that an ambulance should attend. Emergency paramedics arrived on scene at 12.18pm but could not gain access to the deceased's property. The Fire Service was therefore requested to attend. Following a forced entry via rear patio doors at 12.50pm the deceased was discovered in a collapsed, unresponsive condition at the foot of the stairs laying in a pool of dried blood from an obvious head injury. She was verified as dead and beyond any attempted resuscitation. The evidence established that after setting the house alarms and heading up the stairs for bed during the preceding evening, the deceased had missed her footing or lost her balance, falling backwards from about three stairs up, landing in a way that caused her to lose immediate consciousness and having also sustained a laceration to her head, thereafter was to exsanguinate without re-gaining consciousness. By reason of the time at which death could be established, it was determined that accepted suboptimal elements in the assessment, quality of questions asked of people contacting the police and emergency services and the resulting information gathering fell below the standard expected and applied as part of the ‘Right Care, Right Person' response policy, this did not have any bearing upon the outcome. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the Inquest, evidence was heard that: 1. Family members who lived far from the deceased became concerned for the welfare of the deceased and were of the view that she had suffered a medical episode, collapse or adverse event that explained her failure to respond to telephone calls and knocks on the door from friends. 2. The full background of the deceased, her history of falls, her recent bereavement and high risk to have suffered an adverse medical episode, or deliberate or unintended physical harm raised the expectation on the part of the family, that having called the emergency services, entry would be forced to the deceased's residence as they were of the view that there was a real and immediate risk of death or serious harm having occurred. 3. <span style="background-color:#D6D8D9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Active Failures- Mistakes
Keywords: presumed">In fact, calls to the non-emergency 101 and 999 emergency lines evaluated that this was a non-critical emergency and a presumed medical event.</span> This created a significant delay before it was appreciated that entry would need to be forced and the Fire and Rescue Service were requested to attend. 4. There was lack of understanding as to whether the forced entry would be lawful, a matter for the police, or a matter for Fire and Rescue Services in circumstances that the next-of-kin, if asked, would have agreed readily to there being forced entry at the outset and well before their arrival. 5. There was accepted sub-optimal information gathering and evaluation of the category of this emergency with an example of poor training resulting in inappropriate language being used by a call handler. 6. The emergency response had come about because of a new ‘Right Care, Right Person' policy applied by emergency services that, in fact, delivered as a first responder, the wrong person delivering the wrong care to the deceased's residence. 7. Prior to the implementation of ‘Right Care, Right Person' this ‘concern for welfare' emergency would have been dealt with by the attendance of the police on the scene as first responders who would have been likely to have achieved entry as a result of the concern for welfare. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 29, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: [REDACTED], Daughter of Elaine Tarbuck I have also sent it to: Greater Manchester Fire And Rescue Service North West Ambulance Service who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 7 th July 2025 Mr Timothy W Brennand HM Senior Coroner for Manchester West

Deceased name: Sean Fitzgerald
Coroners name: Sir John Saunders
Coroners Area: Coventry and Warwickshire
Category: Police related deaths
This report is being sent to: College of Policing | West Midlands Police
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing, [REDACTED] Rugby Building Leamington Road Ryton-On-Dunsmore Coventry CV8 3EN The Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, [REDACTED] Police Headquarters, Lloyd House Colmore Circus Queensway Birmingham B4 6NQ 1 CORONER I am Sir John Saunders, a former judge of the High Court. Under paragraph 3 of Schedule 10 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, I was nominated by the Lady Chief Justice to conduct an investigation and inquest into the death of Sean Patrick Fitzgerald ("Mr Fitzgerald"). Following that nomination, I have exercised the functions of senior coroner in the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire in relation to the investigation and inquest. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under: (a) Paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5) ; and (b) Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made) . 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST This investigation concerns the death of Mr Fitzgerald, who was fatally shot by a West Midlands Police ("WMP") officer (known as Officer K) on 4 January 2019 during an armed operation at a residential address in Coventry. The investigation commenced on 10 January 2019 and concluded at the end of an inquest hearing on 21 May 2025. In summary, the conclusions at the end of the hearing were as follows: (a) The medical cause of death was: 1a. Gunshot Wound of the Chest. (b) The jury returned a short-form conclusion of death by lawful killing, supplemented with (i) a narrative setting out the circumstances of death and (ii) answers to two supplementary questions which concerned the planning and preparation, and the implementation, of the police firearms operation. The jury's narrative and answers to the two questions are set out in the next section of this report. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATHS The jury returned a supplementary narrative as to the circumstances of Mr Fitzgerald's death, as follows: "On 4 January 2019, Sean Fitzgerald was at a house at [REDACTED] in Coventry. A team of police firearms officers from West Midlands Police arrived at the house to perform a search warrant. At shortly after 6.20pm, officers at the front of the house began using a chainsaw to break down the front door. At this point, Sean Fitzgerald went to the back door, opened it and emerged. A police firearms officer in position about 7.5 feet from the back door discharged his firearm towards Sean Fitzgerald. The shot struck him in the chest and caused serious internal injuries. Despite prompt first aid from police officers and from paramedics and a doctor, it was not possible to resuscitate him, and he died of the gunshot wound. He was declared dead at 6.55pm." The first supplementary question asked: "Do you consider that there was any failure in the planning and preparation for the police firearms operation on 4 January 2019 which may have or did materially contribute to Sean Fitzgerald's death?" The jury answered "Yes" to the first question, providing the following explanation: "1. We are unanimously agreed on the following failures in planning and preparation. It was important that the planning should have stated that MOE [method of entry] would not commence until [Officers] K & F had verbally confirmed they were in place on rear containment. This was a missed opportunity 2. Due to the lack of intelligence on the rear of the property and the surrounding alleyway, it is a serious omission in standard procedure to not consider and assign secondary roles to a certain number of AFO's [authorised firearms officers] should officers F & K request assistance at the rear. 3. Due to the nature of the MOE used, it was seriously inadequate that the Armed Police challenge is not announced before the commencement of MOE." The second supplementary question asked: "Do you consider that there was any failure in the implementation of the police firearms operation on 4 January 2019 which may have or did materially contribute to Sean Fitzgerald's death?" The jury answered "Yes" to the second question, providing the following explanation: "- We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in choosing the positions they took up based on the briefing and the intelligence about the property. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in not requesting the deployment of further officers to the rear based on the briefing. - We unanimously agree that the officers should have announced ‘Armed Police' on the front of the premises, earlier than they did, at a point before MOE [method of entry] commenced. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that officers K + F should have announced Armed Police on the rear of the premises at the point the curtain moved behind the rear door. - We agree on a majority of 10-1 that officers K & F should have turned on their torches at the rear of the property at the point MOE [method of entry] commenced on the front door." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In these circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The matters of concern set out below relate to the training and guidance provided to firearms officers performing tactical options in the context of armed operations. Although firearms operations by their nature vary, my concerns have broad application because they relate to the performance of commonly used tactics and to general principles which apply in armed policing. In considering these matters, I have taken account of evidence from (a) the officers involved; (b) witnesses with experience of local and national training, policies and guidance (including senior firearms training officers); and (c) a range of experts who gave evidence on topics including (i) the conduct of police tactics and (ii) the operation of human perception, cognition and visual processing. Given the risks to life inherent in armed policing, both to the officers and to members of the public, it is important that firearms officers are given the best possible training and support to perform their role. I hope that this report will be considered carefully. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) Training and practice in relation to timing of any announcement of "armed police" in police firearms operations involving containment of properties In the police operation in which Mr Fitzgerald was killed, the officers employed the tactic of "contain and call out with limited entry." This involves firearms officers "containing" a property by surrounding it and providing firearms cover with their weapons; creating a breach by forcing entry; and "calling out" the subjects inside (directing them to leave through the point of breach), without the officers themselves entering. In evidence, it was explained that this is a very common tactic, which is used in a range of scenarios. [REDACTED], a former senior firearms officer and armed policing lead within the College of Policing, gave evidence in the inquest. He explained that an integral part of the tactic is for officers to announce their presence by loud shouts of "armed police." This warns those inside the property that it is the police forcing entry and informs them that the officers are armed. It was explained that this warning helps to avoid confusion and encourage compliance, thereby reducing the risk of harm to officers and occupants. The timing of the announcement is plainly important, and any potential for confusion or for making the announcement at the wrong time risks fatal consequences. [REDACTED] said that the timing of any such announcement is not prescribed by national training or guidance, and that there is no "template" for when it should be done, although he understood that it would usually be made after achieving a breach (e.g. breaking down a door). The procedural and training documents (both national and from WMP) which were put in evidence in the inquest gave no detailed guidance on the subject. The Chief Firearms Instructor at WMP, [REDACTED], gave evidence that WMP trains its officers to make the announcement after achieving a breach. The evidence of the officers involved in the operation as to the recommended or standard practice was inconsistent. The Strategic Firearms Commander said that he expected officers to announce themselves as armed police as soon as they were in position. The Operational Firearms Commander said that the shout should first be made as soon as the chainsaw was being applied to the door and again as the breach was made. One further member of the team said that he thought best practice was to give the shout as the chainsaw was being applied, but he acknowledged that he had not done so on this occasion. Several other members of the team thought that proper practice was only to make the announcement after the door had been breached. The firearms briefing told the officers that method of entry would be conducted and "[o]nce breached, challenges will be made at the threshold and suspects will be handcuffed". There was no further discussion or direction about when the officers should first announce their presence. In the event, the officers at the front of the property did not shout "armed police" before breaking down the two doors at the front of the property. Before any announcement was made, Mr Fitzgerald left through the rear door of the premises and was shot by Officer K, who was providing rear containment. In these circumstances, I am concerned that the guidance and training given to firearms officers on tactics of containing and entering properties (and specifically in relation to the containment and call out with limited entry tactic) does not ensure a clear and consistent understanding of when they should announce their presence, or what factors to consider in deciding when to make the announcement. I am also concerned that the topic was not the subject of more specific discussion or direction in the briefing. It is important that officers conducting these kinds of highly challenging firearms operation should have proper guidance on this subject. If the approach of different officers is inconsistent, there is the clear potential for mistakes to be made and for the lives of officers and others to be put at risk. I appreciate that expert firearms training officers are best placed to produce any further guidance, and that it may not be possible to have a hard and fast rule. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: trained">However, the inconsistent views of highly trained officers which were given in this inquest indicate that the subject ought to be further addressed in training and in formal guidance. (2) Training and practice in relation to positioning of firearms officers in operations against properties (including consideration of the reactionary gap) As set out above, in this case, Officer K was standing between 7 and 8 feet from the rear door of the property as Mr Fitzgerald left.</span> He discharged his firearm within just over half a second of the door beginning to open. The jury found that he had acted lawfully, meaning that he had perceived a threat and had used force commensurate with the threat he perceived. They also found that he had acted reasonably in taking up the position which he took, given the briefing he had received. Nevertheless, the evidence at the inquest gave cause for concern in relation to the training and guidance given to firearms officers on how they should position themselves in operations against properties. In the inquest, two experts in cognition and perception, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], explained that close proximity to a potential source of danger can have a psychological impact, significantly elevating a person's perception of threat and potentially increasing the likelihood that they will respond with force. The experts considered that, in this case, such proximity was likely to have heightened Officer K's perception of threat. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: trained">The inquest heard evidence about the concept of the "reactionary gap", a distance which officers are often trained to maintain between themselves and a subject who presents a threat.</span> In evidence, [REDACTED] discussed this concept, explaining that distance gives officers more time to assimilate information and respond to an approaching threat. [REDACTED] explained that maintaining a reactionary gap prevents officers from being "closed down" by subjects. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: trained">He said that officers are trained on the importance of distance in the context of containment tactics.</span> The firearms training and guidance materials considered in evidence made limited reference to positioning and the reactionary gap. The WMP training materials required students to demonstrate an appropriate reactionary gap in one training exercise and to explain its importance in another. The College of Policing's Authorised Professional Practice on Armed Containment described the benefit of distance, but in terms of reducing stress, tension and the likelihood of a close quarter confrontation. None of the materials gave any detailed consideration to the risks presented by close proximity (including close proximity to entrances rather than subjects) in the context of armed containment of properties. None explained the potential impact of proximity on threat perception and the likelihood that an officer will respond with potentially lethal force. I am concerned that the training and guidance given to firearms officers on how to position themselves, especially in operations against properties, does not include detailed consideration of the risks of taking up position in close proximity to entrances. It does not appear to address the effects of proximity on threat perception and the use of force. As with the first matter of concern, I recognise that it should be for expert firearms training officers to decide how to deal with this subject in training and guidance, and that there will inevitably be situations where a firearms officer has to take up position very close to a doorway or other entrance when containing a property. However, there appears to be a need for further consideration of this issue in the interest of minimising the risks of mistake of fact shootings in the future. Finally, I should stress that in raising this matter of concern, I am not detracting from the jury's conclusions that Officer K's use of force was lawful and that his decision on where to position himself was reasonable in light of the briefing and intelligence. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe that the College of Policing and West Midlands Police are bodies which have the power to take such action. The College of Policing has responsibility for overseeing training and guidance to firearms officers at the national level and has the power to make changes to address the matters of concern identified above. West Midlands Police is responsible for conducting local training (including refresher training) for its firearms officers and for issuing local guidance. The force thus has the power to make changes to local practices and guidance to address the matters of concern identified above. 7 YOUR RESPONSE A response to this report should be provided within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 September 2025. As coroner, I am able to extend the period if appropriate. Your response should contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you should explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to those other than WMP who are Interested Persons in the inquest, namely: (i) the family of Mr Fitzgerald; (ii) Officer K; (iii) West Mercia Police; (iv) Warwickshire Police; and (v) the Independent Office for Police Conduct. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all Interested Persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish this report and/or any response to it in complete, redacted or summary forms. She may send a copy of this report and/or any response to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 Dated 8 July 2025 Sir John Saunders

Deceased name: David Gifford
Coroners name: Debbie Rookes
Coroners Area: Avon
Category: Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: Association of Ambulance Chief Executives
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) 1 CORONER I am Debbie Rookes, Assistant Coroner for the Coroner Area of Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 December 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Stewart Gifford. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural causes The cause of death was recorded as: 1a Ruptured thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm 1b Fractured stent and endoleak 1c Aortic dissection and multiple aortic aneurysms - stented 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH David Gifford had an extensive medical history with significant co-morbidities.</span> He had a long cardiac history which included aortic dissection, multiple aortic aneurysms and heart failure. He first underwent surgery for aortic dissection in 2006. He subsequently underwent further surgery on multiple occasions for further stenting and grafting to repair additional ruptures to his aorta. He developed an endoleak which was monitored and remained stable for many years, until it required surgery in 2023. Mr Gifford died on 26 November 2024 at Southmead Hospital. His death was caused by an acute ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, following the development of a fractured stent and endoleak at some point in the weeks preceding his death. It was not clear for exactly how long this endoleak had been present, or when the fracture occurred. In the weeks before his death, Mr Gifford had had multiple visits to his GP surgery. He was a complex patient with a number of medical condition and he had been experiencing a range of symptoms. The clinicians he saw referred him for further investigations into his symptoms. In the afternoon of 25 November 2024, Mr Gifford made a 999 call to the ambulance due to right-sided neck pain which radiated down his back and to his flank. He had been experiencing this pain since August 2024. Paramedics attended in the evening, and after an assessment, they did not think he needed to be conveyed to hospital. Worsening advice was given which resulted in Mr Gifford calling 999 again late that evening and an ambulance arrived in the early hours of 26 November 2024. He was conveyed to hospital and then transferred to Southmead Hospital, where he lost cardiac output whilst still on the trolley. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Training and knowledge focuses on the classic signs and symptoms associated with an AAA. However, there are a group of patients who will not present in this way, and who may be challenging to diagnose. Whilst there may be many medical conditions that could be similar, there does not seem to be much focus given to the identification of vascular emergencies within training and knowledge updates. Therefore when paramedics attend emergencies, in the absence of classic symptoms, they may be wrongly reassured. Where a person has an extensive aortic history, the importance of aortic pathology should be considered. There has not been training or medical education for ambulance on vascular emergencies for a long time. The evidence was that JRCALC guidelines did recently highlight the number of patients that may not present with the traditional ‘red flags' but did not provide further guidance. This is a national issue where ambulance staff should be knowledgeable about the more subtle signs of vascular emergencies that may be missed. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to [REDACTED], son, and [REDACTED], daughter-in-law of the deceased, and to the Chief Coroner. I have also sent a copy to South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. I am also under a duty to send the chief coroner a copy of your response. The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the chief coroner. 9 7 July 2025 Debbie Rookes Assistant Coroner

Deceased name: Ann Caldicott
Coroners name: Sarah Clarke
Coroners Area: North East Kent
Category: Community health care and emergency services related deaths | Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: East Kent University Hospitals Foundation Trust | The Manor Clinic Folkestone Kent
Regulation 28: Report to Prevent Future Deaths For the attention of: East Kent University Hospitals Foundation Trust The Manor Clinic Folkestone Kent 1 CORONER I am Sarah Clarke, Area Coroner for North East Kent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL DUTY I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST An inquest into the death of Mrs Ann Caldicott, aged 66, was opened on 8 th July 2024 and concluded on the 7 th April 2025. The medical cause of death was: - 1a. Septic Shock - 1b. Generalised Peritonitis - 1c. Iatrogenic Bladder Perforation - II. Congestive Heart Failure, Ischaemic Heart Disease, Hypertensive Heart Disease, Generalised Atherosclerosis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Atrial Fibrillation, Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease The conclusion of the inquest was a Narrative Conclusion as follows: "Mrs Ann Caldicott was admitted to hospital on the 17th January 2024 having been unwell for some time with lack of appetite, weight loss and dehydration amongst other symptoms. She had become increasingly frail despite numerous interactions with both primary and secondary care. On her final admission Mrs Caldicott underwent investigations including a kidney biopsy complicated by bleeding and she was found to have a perforated bladder caused by the insertion of a urinary catheter. Mrs Caldicott was considered too physiologically frail to undergo the treatment required to fix the perforated bladder and Mrs Caldicott died in hospital on the 21st February 2024" 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs Caldicott had a long-standing history of weight loss, anaemia, and deterioration in renal function. Despite multiple attendances and admissions to both primary and secondary care, no adequate nutritional assessment, referral to specialist services, or frailty intervention occurred. These failures contributed to a profound physiological decline. On her final admission, a urinary catheter insertion resulted in a bladder perforation. Due to her poor physiological reserve, she was deemed unfit for the necessary surgical intervention and died in hospital on 21 February 2024. 5 CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. The matters of concern are as follows: 1. Ann's malnutrition and declining frailty were not investigated despite continued requests by Ann and her family to primary and secondary care settings. 2. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: not suitable">Ann's marked anaemia and poor nutritional state meant that she was not suitable for potentially lifesaving treatment when it became necessary. 3.</span> No internal investigations were conducted by Ann's GP or by the East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to establish if lessons could be learned as a result of the circumstances of Ann's Death. 4. The Court was informed that there had been an SJR (of which I had not previously been notified) following Ann's death. The Dr providing evidence was to raise a Datix in relation to Ann's previous attendances and failed discharges. At the resumed inquest the Court were informed these investigations had not taken place and were not to take place. 5. No consideration was given prior to Ann's final admission and some 18 months after the onset of symptoms of vomiting and chronic weightless, of support for Ann's nutritional status. 6. If Ann had been in a better nutritional state on her final admission to the Kent and Canterbury, then she would have been well enough to undergo lifesaving treatment following the bladder perforation. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 th August 2025. I, the Coroner, may extend this period if necessary. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. If no action is proposed, you must explain why. 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of this report to: - The Chief Coroner - The family of Mrs Ann Caldicott - East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust - The Manor Clinic I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who received the report. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both this report and your response on the Judiciary website. 9 DATE 07 June 2025 SIGNED Sarah Clarke Area Coroner for North East Kent

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1) Chief Executive SSP Health Ltd. 3rd Floor, Waterside House, Waterside Drive, WIGAN WN3 5AZ 2) [REDACTED], Chief Executive Cumbria Health Ltd , 4 Wavell Drive, Rosehill Estate, CARLISLE CA1 2SE 3) [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Northwest Ambulance Service NHS Trust , Ladybridge Hall, Chorley New Rd, BOLTON BL1 5DD 4) [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , 39 Victoria Street, LONDON SW1H 0EU 1 CORONER I am Dr Nicholas Shaw, HM Assistant Coroner for Cumbria 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26th November 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Raymond MALLINSON who died in Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle on 23rd November 2024 aged 79. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest opened on 11th March 2025 and heard on 19th June 2025. The Record of Inquest read as follows: "Thomas Raymond Mallinson died in Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle on 23rd November 2024. He had developed gastroenteritis which, despite repeated pleas from his wife went without any effective response or treatment from health services for four days. When finally admitted to hospital he was gravely ill and died despite treatment escalation to intensive care. Had he been admitted to hospital in a timely manner it is most likely he would have survived" The narrative conclusion was that "Death was due to natural disease. Significant delay amounting to neglect was a major causative factor". The Medical cause of death was given as: 1a Cardiogenic Shock and Acute Kidney Failure 1b Gastroenteritis II Heart Failure, Atrial Fibrillation 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Thomas Mallinson who had a history including Type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease became unwell on 17th November with acute vomiting and diarrhoea. The following day Monday 18th (second day of illness) his wife rang Carlisle Central Practice to request a GP appointment; she was told that no appointments were available and advised to ring NHS 111 for advice after 6pm that evening (not before because her call would be referred back to the practice where there were no appointments!). Thomas remained unwell so his wife called 111 and after an assessment and callback an hour later an ambulance was sent. The emergency medical technician assessed Thomas fully, all his observations were normal and so he was left with advice to try the GP practice again the following day if symptoms persisted On Tuesday 19th (third day of illness) Thomas was no better, his wife did receive a telephone appointment from the GP practice and was issued a prescription for an anti- diarrhoeal medication. On Wednesday 20th (fourth day of illness) Thomas was getting weaker and had soiled due to the diarrhoea. 111 was called again at 5.30 pm and she was told that she had secured the last GP telephone appointment of the day at 6.30: that call never came. Getting desperate his wife rang 999 just before midnight, help was not sent but she was told a doctor from Cumbria Health (the out of hours provider) would call back within 2 hours: despite waiting up until 4am that call never came either. On Thursday 21st (fifth day of illness). "After another terrible night of continuous vomiting and diarrhoea" the GP surgery was again called and an afternoon telephone appointment offered. "Utterly exasperated stressed and traumatized" his wife again tried 999 and this time an ambulance was sent. Thomas collapsed shortly after the crew arrived, they recognized how ill he was and took him to hospital immediately. On arrival in A&E Thomas was found to be hypotensive and hypothermic with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. Despite escalation to intensive care he developed refractory cardiogenic shock and died on 23rd November. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) To SSP Health, owners and operators of Carlisle Central Practice, 65 Warwick Road, Carlisle. I wish to thank [REDACTED] for his attendance and and assistance at the hearing. It was acknowledged that on 18th the advice "to call back tomorrow" should never have been given and that the telephone appointment the following day really ought to have been a face to face assessment either in surgery or at Thomas's home. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: elderly">I am concerned that no body or organization has taken responsibility for Thomas, an elderly man with significant co- morbidities, during his illness.</span> Should this responsibility ultimately rest with a patients general practitioner, if not where does it rest? (2) To Cumbria Health (CH). Thomas's case was sent electronically to the service, marked for 2 hour attention. I appreciate why this did not take place as it was impossible for clinicians on night duty to triage a large number of calls waiting while actually visiting and treating their caseload. I note a new "OPEL" system has since been instituted to try to escalate and get extra help as the number of calls waiting increases, but where will these extra resources come from overnight? I am also concerned that the referral from NWAS came as a result of a 999 emergency phone call but there seemed to be no way of telling NWAS that the call had not been dealt with and (presumably) passing responsibility back to them. As referred to above -where does responsibility lie? (3) To Northwest Ambulance Service (NWAS) as providers of both 111 and 999 responses in Cumbria. There were multiple calls to 111 and 999 in this case. I was told that there was no alert to a call handler to indicate recent contacts for the same patient with the same condition which might highlight a need for more decisive action. I am also concerned that (as above) there is no system that alerts your control to the fact that a 999 (emergency) case you have passed to another agency has not in fact been dealt with. A further concern refers specifically to the 111 service. At inquest it was questioned whether for out of hours GP services Cumbria had been better served when calls went to a local control room in Carlisle. (4) To [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health. In my summing up after hearing the evidence in this case I explained the legal concept of neglect as a failure to provide basic care and (in this case) medical attention for someone in a dependent condition who can not provide it for himself, and I remarked that I felt Thomas "had fallen through an overcomplex system and was indeed neglected". I am aware that you are hoping to develop a 10 year plan for the NHS and therefore feel it my duty to highlight this case to you as an example of how overcomplexity has lost sight of a man's urgent care needs. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organizations have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27th August 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Thomas's widow [REDACTED] and their daughter [REDACTED]. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 30 June 2025 Signature Dr Nicholas Shaw HM Assistant Coroner for Cumbria.

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | NHS England | Stepping Hill Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Health NHS England Stepping Hill Hospital 1 CORONER Christopher Murray HM Assistant Coroner Manchester South Coronial Area Mount Tabor Stockport 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 st March 2024 an investigation was opened into the death of Neil John Clarke aged 81 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 st May 2025. Sitting without a jury I made a determination that Neil John Clark died as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, aspiration pneumonia and infarcted bowel arising as a consequence of aspiration secondary to vomiting which precipitated a cardiac arrest following a right hemicolectomy. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Neil Clarke was a fit 81 year old who was investigated by way of colonoscopy following reports of bowel discomfort. A colonoscopy and polypectomy were carried out on 12th December 2022. Two polyps were removed and were benign. A repeat colonoscopy on 29th August 2023 showed recurrence of a polyp in the caecum. Endoscopic mucosal resection polypectomy failed. A discussion in MDT took place and the consensus was to proceed with a right hemicolectomy. The options provided to Mr Clarke were conservative management, further polypectomy or a right hemicolectomy. The latter was advised as the most appropriate option by clinicians as it would involve one invasive procedure rather than two and provide clarity as to the nature of the polyps being cancerous or benign. The surgery carried out on 12th February 2024 at Stepping Hill Hospital was uneventful save for some post operative bleeding. Once stabilised he was transferred to ward D5 on 15th February 2024. He felt unwell that afternoon and vomited. His ward lights were turned out at 23:00 and he was made comfortable. At 02:00 on 16th February he was agitated and then violently vomited before suffering a cardiac arrest. CPR was administered and he was taken to the intensive care unit where he was treated and monitored. Sadly, he had suffered a hypoxic encephalopathy following aspiration secondary to vomiting. He went on to develop aspiration pneumonia and an infarcted bowel which in conjunction with his hypoxic encephalopathy resulted in his death at Stepping Hill Hospital on 26th February 2024. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The evidence heard during the inquest into Neil John Clarke's death and the findings confirmed there were a number of factors contributing to Neil's death which are of concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Chief Executive NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board The Council House First Floor Corporation Street Derby DE1 2FS [REDACTED] 2. [REDACTED], Chief Executive National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 3rd floor 3 Piccadilly Place Manchester M1 3BN [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Peter Nieto, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Derby and Derbyshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 . 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aaron ATKINSON aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: - Unascertained 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Aaron was found deceased on the morning of 20 April 2023 at his home address. His death was completely unexpected. As his cause of death was not known a postmortem examination was conducted including toxicology. The pathologist's opinion was that Aaron had died due to a seizure and positional asphyxia. Aaron's mother was doubtful of the cause of death proposed and pressed for a second postmortem which was undertaken by a different pathologist. That pathologist considered that a more likely cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia caused by Aaron's prescription of Risperidone (for behavioural regulation), and Ritalin (for ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). On the court's assessment of the evidence, applying the balance of probabilities, a probable medical cause of death cannot be determined. The court notes that Aaron's medication reviews to check for any complications were conducted in line with local health guidelines. Aaron's last review took place in November 2021, but Aaron did not attend subsequent reviews which were offered. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Whilst Aaron had annual GP reviews related to prescription of anti-psychotic medication (Risperidone, although the inquest heard that prescription of Ritalin was also a relevant factor, particularly in combination with Risperidone), to check for signs of adverse side effects and physical health complications, those reviews did not include ECGs (electrocardiograms) to check for signs of adverse effects on electrical activity of the heart. On the medical evidence before the inquest antipsychotic medication carries recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">It does not appear that the recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias from long term prescription of antipsychotic medication is reflected in guidance to medical practitioners and prescribers, nationally or locally in terms of performing ECGs.</span> The relevant NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance (web link below) refers to ECG testing under How should I monitor someone taking antipsychotics? and recommends Electrocardiography (ECG) - after dose changes. Ideally, also annually. The local Derbyshire Integrated Care Board guidance (web link below) does not identify need for ECG to be included in annual monitoring in primary care unless if new medicines or changes to physical health have increased the risk of prolonged QTc arrange ECG. It appears there is lack of clarity and consistency for annual reviews to include ECGs where people are prescribed antipsychotic medication long term. Given the recognised risks explained at inquest then not providing annual ECGs for long term users of those medications appears to pose risk of death.

I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED], mother of Aaron. [REDACTED], GP. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 30 June 2025 Peter Nieto Senior Coroner Derby and Derbyshire

This report is being sent to: National Highways
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: National Highways [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Sean CUMMINGS, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Leigh NARDELLI aged 46. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 03 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Road traffic collision Road traffic collision 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Leigh Nardelli died on the A5 Southbound in Milton Keynes on the 6th July 2024. He was driving a Mercedes AMG car at speed in torrential rain. There was extensive water pooling on the A5. There was dashcam footage of the vehicle aquaplaning and losing control. The offside of the vehicle hit the central reservation and travelled along it for a distance before hitting a ramped terminal of a further section of restraint barrier. This had been in place to protect the concrete support pillar of an overhead bridge. However, it is acutely ramped and allowed Mr Nardelli's vehicle to be projected up it, travel along the top before entering a wider space between the barriers on the south and northside. The vehicle then seems to have descended and "flipped" becoming airborne and striking the concrete support causing fatal injuries. The barrier ramp, known as a "P1 terminal" had been due for replacement to a safer bifurcated system in 2022 but for financial reasons was not. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The hazard posed by the design of the P1 terminal was known by National Highways and it was due for replacement at the site of the collision in 2022.</span> It presented and continues to present a significant risk and was not replaced for financial reasons. There is a gradual roll out programme across National Highways to replace P1 terminals with a safer bifurcated system but I consider the implications of the financial limitations represents an ongoing safety concern for vehicles approaching them on designated roads. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 12, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons I have also sent it to Thames Valley Police who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Chris Morris, Area Coroner for Greater Manchester (South). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 th February 2025, an inquest was opened into the death of Brenda Fisher who died at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport on 16 th January 2025, aged 86 years. The investigation concluded with an inquest which I heard on 23rd June 2025. The inquest heard evidence that Mrs Fisher died as a consequence of: 1)a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis; b) Cellulitis from leg ulcers; II Rhabdomyolysis following long lie; heart failure At the end of the inquest, I recorded a conclusion of Accident. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs Fisher died on 16th January 2025 at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport as a consequence of complications arising from wounds initially sustained in a minor accident at home which would not heal as a result of her complex underlying health problems. Mrs Fisher's death was contributed to by Rhabdomyolysis. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The court heard evidence that on her final attendance to hospital, Mrs Fisher was cared for in the Emergency Department's ‘Rapid Assessment and Triage' Corridor for at least 23 hours before a bed was found for her. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Whilst the Trust has undertaken a number of steps locally to mitigate the risks associated with this practice, I am concerned that there remains a residual and inherent risk of death arising from patients remaining for lengthy periods in areas not designed or intended for undertaking observations and providing care. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22nd August 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Category: Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths
This report is being sent to: Kenny & Murphy Limited
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Director, Kenny & Murphy Limited 1 CORONER I am Vanessa McKinlay, Assistant Coroner for Somerset 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Ernest Kerslake. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Accidental Death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kenny & Murphy was the landlord company for Colley Lane Industrial Estate in Bridgwater where the accident occurred on 7 September 2023. Mr Kerslake's fatal injuries were sustained when he was tasked by a different company to strim vegetation at two specific sites on the estate. Having completed those two sites, he proceeded (uninstructed) to strim the vegetation at the foot of an electricity pylon on the estate. The machinery used was a petrol-driven brush cutter with a metal blade. In the course of strimming, Mr Kerslake cut through an 11kV electricity cable which was attached in the usual way to one of the vertical wooden poles of the pylon. The blade of the machine cut through the cable guard and the cable itself, causing the electrical explosion in which Mr Kerslake was injured. The jury found that the medical cause of death was: 1a Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome 1b 52% Total Body Surface Area Burns 1c Electrical Explosion 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Safety Culture + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT DATED 31 MARCH 2025 IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive - Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Chief Executive - Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (Musgrove Park Hospital. 1 CORONER I am Philip SPINNEY, HM Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of The County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 25 May 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 25-27 March 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe died due to complications of necrotising otitis externa 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe had a complex past medical history.</span> In April 2021 he was diagnosed with the ear infection otitis externa. Between April 2021 and May 2022 he received treatment across three hospital trusts whilst he was also being treated for other health conditions. Despite the treatment the infection progressed and entered the bones in his skull. On 11 May 2022 he died at his home address in Croyde, Devon, due to the progression of the infection. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The evidence shows that Mr Tizard-Varcoe's overall treatment for the ear infections between April 2021 and May 2022 was provided across three different health trusts and hospitals, Musgrove Park in Taunton, North Devon District Hospital in Barnstable and Exeter Hospital; it is acknowledged that this was as a consequence of Mr Tizard- Varcoe's vascular disease (being treated at Musgrove Park) and the locations of specialist doctors. Whilst being treated at Musgrove Park for a vascular problem, Mr Tizard-Varcoe consulted with ear nose and throat specialists for ear pain; subsequently between April 2021 and May 2022 he was seen on a number of occasions by clinicians in all three locations; this led to occasions when Mr Tizard -Varcoe was reviewed by clinicians without the full clinical picture due to the inability of separate hospital trusts to access each other's medical records. The evidence revealed that on occasions it was difficult for Mr Tizard-Varcoe's GP to work out who had responsibility for his care. It is my judgement that on occasions this led to less than optimal treatment for Mr Tizard Varcoe. (2) In addition, the evidence revealed that there were three occasions when Mr Tizard-Varcoe was not followed up as an outpatient in a timely manner (August 2021, November 2021 and February 2022). On one occasion Mr Tizard-Varcoe possibly ran out of antibiotic medication and on another Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged without antibiotic medication. The lack of timely follow up appointments resulted in reduced monitoring and assessment and a poor understanding of the effectiveness of treatment and the progression of his ear infection. (3) In addition, on the 1 November 2021, Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged from the Royal and Devon Hospital without a prescription for oral antibiotics despite advice from microbiologists to do so; the evidence showed that this was a clinical decision made by a junior ear nose and throat doctor against an improving clinical picture. The discharge was overseen by a consultant from a different specialism due to Mr Tizard- Varcoe's health needs at the time. Evidence at the inquest from the responsible ear nose and throat consultant, indicated that he would probably have prescribed antibiotics on advice of microbiologists. Due to the progression of the infection from the ear canal into the bone at the base of the skull there is a real possibility that the clinical presentation did not reflect the true situation and this was a missed opportunity to provide continuity of treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN (1) Consideration should be given to reviewing the process of managing and treating patients with multiple health conditions, being treated across different hospital trusts, to ensure greater coordination, collaboration and optimal treatment. (2) Consideration should be given to reviewing arrangements for follow-up outpatient appointments in the ear, nose and throat departments in the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and the Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, to ensure effective monitoring. (3) Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust to consider reviewing the arrangements for patient discharge in circumstances where a patient is being treated across different specialisms, to ensure that there is consultant oversight in all areas of ongoing treatment. In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 28 th May 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the family and the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 SIGNED: Mr Philip C Spinney HM Senior Coroner

Deceased name: Karl Dunstan
Coroners name: Tom Osborne
Coroners Area: Milton Keynes
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Milton Keynes University Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] - CEO Milton Keynes University Hospital 1 CORONER I am Tom OSBORNE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karl Fraser DUNSTAN aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative conclusion The deceased died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14th January 2025 from a pulmonary embolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis. The opportunity to investigate and treat the pulmonary embolism was missed when the request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was declined without D-dimer testing and, when his clinical condition declined, was not met with emergency treatment for a pulmonary embolism. The missed opportunities more than minimally contributed to his death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Karl Dunstan died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14th January 2025 from a pulmonary thromboembolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis. He had been admitted to the hospital the previous day with symptoms suggestive of a chest infection, but also with clinical features indicative of a pulmonary embolism, including shortage of breath, episodes of collapse and hypoxia. A request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was denied by the radiologist as it did not meet their criteria. There was a failure to perform a D-dimer test that if positive would have led to a CTPA that would have confirmed the pulmonary embolism. This would have resulted in thrombolysis being started when he collapsed. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: radiology">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: That the investigation of a pulmonary embolism was not carried out in accordance with NICE guidance, and a request for a CT pulmonary angiogram by the consultant was rejected by the radiology department because it did not meet the threshold of the Wells score used by the Hospital and yet a D-dimer test was not completed, that if positive, would have resulted in a CTPA.</span> The policy and procedure is in need of an urgent review. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 18, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The family of Mr Dunstan who may find it useful or of interest.
