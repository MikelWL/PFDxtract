REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Department of Health & Social Care 2. Department of Housing, Community and Local Government 3. HSE 1 CORONER I am Lydia Brown, senior coroner, for the coroner area of West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION On 23 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Wessam al Jundi, age 28. The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not yet been heard. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Diagnosis of severe silicosis lung disease. Awaiting lung transplant. Admitted on Friday 17th May 2024 for potential lung transplant to Harefield Hospital. Had deteriorated since last review with pulmonary hypertension. Bedside echo showed severe pulmonary hypertension with pericardial effusion and left ventricular compromise. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: too unwell, not suitable">Not suitable for transplant as too unwell.</span> Deteriorated and died in hospital on 22 May 2024. Cause of death 1a Respiratory Failure 1b Silicosis (Occupational lung disease) Wessam had been working with artificial stone products which contain a very high percentage of Crystalline silica content. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust">The dust created when these products are cut, sanded and carved creates respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and is too fine to see with normal lighting.</span> It is recognised to cause silicosis if inhaled which causes a hardening or scarring of the lung tissue with initially no symptoms. Once silicosis develops it is untreatable apart from offering lung transplantation. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust, exposure to">The health risks are almost entirely preventable if exposure to dust is adequately controlled. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: exposure to">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - This young man presented with an untreatable lung condition probably caused by exposure to RCS in his workplace.</span> This company, "Yes, Marble Ltd" is no longer trading. Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year surveillance programmes. In this case exposure appears to have commenced in May 2016 and he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2021, a mere 5 years after initial exposure. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust, unsafe conditions">Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure.</span> Australia has already taken the decision in 2024 to ban these artificial stone products. There are a number of patients in the UK currently awaiting lung transplants due to RCS exposure from their workplaces. The last 2 decades have seen rapid growth in the use of artificial stone and this death demonstrates the emergence of a severe progressive accelerated form of silicosis. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: equipment + dust, working conditions">Many of the companies specialising in the finishing process of working with this product have a small number of employees and there appears to be an absence of safe working conditions, with no adequate water suppression systems for the dust created, in adequate respiratory personal protection equipment and absent or inadequate ventilatory systems.</span> This is therefore continuing to put the workforce at risk of death due to untreatable lung compromise. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 rd December 2024.

This report is being sent to: Kenny & Murphy Limited
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Director, Kenny & Murphy Limited 1 CORONER I am Vanessa McKinlay, Assistant Coroner for Somerset 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Ernest Kerslake. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Accidental Death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kenny & Murphy was the landlord company for Colley Lane Industrial Estate in Bridgwater where the accident occurred on 7 September 2023. Mr Kerslake's fatal injuries were sustained when he was tasked by a different company to strim vegetation at two specific sites on the estate. Having completed those two sites, he proceeded (uninstructed) to strim the vegetation at the foot of an electricity pylon on the estate. The machinery used was a petrol-driven brush cutter with a metal blade. In the course of strimming, Mr Kerslake cut through an 11kV electricity cable which was attached in the usual way to one of the vertical wooden poles of the pylon. The blade of the machine cut through the cable guard and the cable itself, causing the electrical explosion in which Mr Kerslake was injured. The jury found that the medical cause of death was: 1a Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome 1b 52% Total Body Surface Area Burns 1c Electrical Explosion 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

This report is being sent to: Gas Safety Register
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Gas Safety Register 1 CORONER I am Jason PEGG, HM Acting Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11th November 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Oliver HILL aged 18. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2nd June 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased died on 28th October 2015 in the rear of an ambulance on a road between Brechin and Dundee, Scotland.</span> The deceased inhaled a fatal quantity of carbon monoxide whilst in the bathroom of Glenmark Cottage, Glenesk, Angus, Scotland whilst preparing for a bath. The carbon monoxide had been expelled from a lit liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater. The bathroom was of insufficient size for the flue-less liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater to be safely used without causing a build-up of carbon monoxide. The liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater burner plaques were cracked which contributed to the death by exacerbating the build-up of carbon monoxide. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The flue-less liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater was operated in a room which was too small dimension so to safely use the heater without causing a build-up of carbon monoxide. A warning label was affixed inside the cabinet heater in the space occupied by the liquified petroleum gas bottle. There was an absence of a visible warning label on the outside of the heater. It was not obvious to all potential users of the heater that the heater could only be used safely in a room of sufficient dimension. The risk applies particularly so in the case of rented cottages and similar premises such as Glenmark Cottage. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 05, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I have also sent it to National Residential Landlords Association who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 10/06/2025 Jason PEGG HM Acting Senior Coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton

The Civil Aviation Authority (The CAA) Aviation House Beehive Ringroad Crawley West Sussex RH6 0YR (By email to: [REDACTED]) 1 CORONER I am Professor Catherine Mason, Coroner for the coroner area of Senior Leicester City and South Leicestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under: (a) Paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 ( https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5 ); and (b) Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 ( https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made ). 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUESTS On 6 November 2018, I commenced an investigation into the deaths of the five people who lost their lives in the helicopter crash at King Power Stadium, Leicester, on 27 October 2018. The names of the five people were Eric Swaffer, Izabela Lechowicz, Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquests hearing on 28 January 2025. The conclusions at the end of the hearing were in summary as follows: (a) The medical cause of death for each of the five people other than Izabela Lechowicz was: 1a. Inhalation of the products of combustion, while the medical cause of death for Ms Lechowicz was: 1a. Head and chest injuries. (b) The jury returned a short-form conclusion of death by accident for each of those who died, supplemented with a narrative setting out the circumstances of death (as set out in the next section of this report). 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATHS The jury returned a supplementary narrative as to the circumstances of the deaths, as follows: "On the 27 th October 2018, an Agusta Westland 169 helicopter, registration G-VSKP, departed the King Power stadium in Leicester. It was piloted by Eric Swaffer and Izabela Lechowicz, carrying passengers Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare. The destination was Stansted Airport in the UK and the helicopter departed at 8.37pm British Summer Time. After the helicopter reached the appropriate take-off decision point, the pilot initiated a right turn. The helicopter spun out of control and crash landed at 8.38pm British Summer Time in the car park of the King Power Stadium, Leicester. The helicopter hit a 0.5 metre high concrete step, rupturing the fuel tank, and came to rest on its left side with no means of escape. Izabela Lechowicz sustained head and chest injuries on impact, which proved fatal. Leaking fuel ignited, resulting in rapid spread of fire. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Eric Swaffer, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare died due to inhalation of the products of combustion. The subsequent AAIB [Air Accidents Investigation Branch] investigation concluded that due to likely rolling contact fatigue, the tail rotor duplex bearing seized, commencing a sequence of events leading to the crash of the helicopter. This included rotation and detachment of the actuator control shaft, loss of yaw control and uncontrollable spinning. In effect, the tail rotor control system became uncontrollable. The helicopter had all appropriate airworthiness and maintenance certificates. It was found that the pilot, Eric Swaffer, took all appropriate and available options to him, to try and regain control of the helicopter." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquests, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">The matters of concern set out below all relate to the systems and procedures for design and safety supervision of aircraft, specifically helicopters.</span> They are founded upon specialist technical evidence given to the court during the inquests. They take full account of action taken by EASA to date of which the court is aware. I should stress at the outset that the matters of concern set out below remain valid irrespective of whether the AAIB's causal explanation of the accident is correct. Each one is based on a safety concern which exists even if the points raised by EASA in response to that causal explanation have merit. It should also be stressed that none of these matters of concern should be interpreted as levelling implicit criticism at the aircraft or component manufacturers involved in this case. They are all concerned with achieving safety improvements for the future. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure of an individual component or system in a helicopter, I hope that this report will be considered carefully. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) Provision of system and flight-testing data by aircraft manufacturers to suppliers In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team explained that they had recommended that EASA amend Certification Specification 29.602 to require type design manufacturers to provide the results of all relevant system and flight testing to any supplier who retains the sole expertise to assess the performance and reliability of components identified as critical parts within a specific system application, to verify that such components can safely meet the in-serve operational demands, prior to the certification of the overall system.</span> This was AAIB safety recommendation SR-2023-018. As [REDACTED] (AAIB Principal Inspector) explained in his evidence, in this case the bearing manufacturer (SKF Aerospace) was the only party which could fully assess the contact pressures that loads experienced during flight tests generated on the duplex bearing which ultimately failed. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">He further explained that it would have been a desirable improvement to the design and certification process if the aircraft manufacturer had been required to provide system and flight-testing data to the bearing manufacturer, so that it could have used its unique expertise to identify risks arising from in-service use. [REDACTED] explained that EASA had responded to this recommendation by saying that another part of the relevant regulations required the aircraft type certificate holder to be responsible for demonstration of compliance (i.e. for showing that critical parts and systems met performance requirements).</span> He said that this was an inadequate response, because it did not meet the intent of the safety recommendation by introducing the specific improvement proposed. [REDACTED] of SKF gave evidence in relation to this safety recommendation. He said that the data his company would receive from manufacturers if the recommendation were implemented would be useful to SKF. He said that his company would not find it difficult to manage being provided with data as required. He noted that data of this kind had been made available in relation to the duplex bearing as a result of the AAIB investigation. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: design + mechanism">In these circumstances, I am concerned by EASA's rejection of the AAIB safety recommendation, which would appear to propose a meaningful improvement to requirements for aircraft design work. (2) Requirements for Certification Specification to address rolling contact fatigue failure In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team explained that they had recommended that EASA introduce further requirements to Certification Specification 29 so as specifically to address premature rolling contact fatigue failure as a failure mechanism across the full bearing operating spectrum and service life of bearings used in safety-critical applications.</span> This was AAIB safety recommendation SR-2023-019. [REDACTED] explained in evidence that this safety recommendation was not prescriptive. It asked EASA to propose requirements which would address risks of premature rolling contact fatigue in bearings, the form of failure which the AAIB concluded had caused the catastrophic accident in this case. As [REDACTED] explained, EASA is undertaking work which looks at the fatigue tolerance of principal structural elements and at the possibility of changing acceptable means of compliance (AMC) for those items. As part of this work, EASA is considering adding clarification and detail which might meet the AAIB recommendation. This reflects the position stated by EASA in its letter of 6 February 2024. I am concerned that an issue raised by the AAIB to the effect that CS-29 and/or AMC may be improved to address risks of rolling contact fatigue failure in critical part bearings has not been addressed by EASA by a time over 18 months after the AAIB report on this crash was issued. (3) Airworthiness status and control of life limits for non-structural critical parts of aircraft designs already in service In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team explained that they had recommended that EASA should define the airworthiness status of life limits on non-structural critical parts and how they should be controlled in service. They said that they had recommended this in relation to aircraft designs not yet in service (safety recommendation SR-2023-020) and in relation to aircraft designs already in service (safety recommendation SR-2023-021). [REDACTED] in his evidence pointed out that this recommendation did not raise an issue of causal relevance to this particular accident, but that it was nevertheless important to ensure greater clarity as regards the life limits of non-structural critical parts. He said that new AMC introduced by Amendment 11 of Certification Specification 29 had adequately addressed the recommendation in relation to aircraft designs to be put into service in future, but that EASA had decided not to make any changes which would secure the requisite additional clarity in relation to designs already in service. As he put it "those aircraft already in service will not benefit from the Amendment 11 changes to life control." In these circumstances, I am concerned that EASA has not implemented the recommendation in relation to designs already in service. Although [REDACTED] said that EASA had explained that it considered that issues with non-structural critical parts would be picked up as part of continued airworthiness review, that does not strike me as a response which meets the recommendation. (4) Comprehensive programme for assessment of critical parts after removal from service In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team explained that they had recommended that EASA amend CS 29.602 to require aircraft manufacturers to implement a comprehensive programme for assessing critical parts after removal from service. AAIB safety recommendation SR-2023-022 addressed this topic for aircraft yet to be put into service, while safety recommendation SR-2023-023 addressed the topic for designs already in service. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">As [REDACTED] explained this recommendation, it was "for EASA to require a closed-loop system for critical components removed from helicopters so that anything that is removed that is classified as a critical part has some form of... assessment programme carried out on it to ensure that... it is progressing throughout its service life in the manner that was expected at the design stage using the design assumptions." He told the court that such a system would have meant that, when duplex bearings were removed from the AW-169 helicopter at the end of their service life, at least a sample would have been reviewed by Leonardo and/or SKF to verify design assumptions.</span> As I understand it, EASA has responded positively to the recommendation as regarding aircraft designs yet to be put into service. It has published a notice of proposed amendment to CS 29 with a view to implementing a Continued Integrity Verification Programme (CIVP). This work is still ongoing. However, EASA has indicated to the AAIB that it does not intend to make any regulatory change for in-service aircraft, because existing procedures are sufficient. [REDACTED] told the court that this response from EASA did not allow in- service helicopters to benefit from the proposed CIVP. He acknowledged that there were some existing requirements which could identify adverse trends or deficiencies in relation to critical parts (such as the duplex bearing which failed in this case) but he stressed that they were not prescriptive enough, given the safety issues underlying the recommendations. [REDACTED] of SKF told the court that the safety recommendation with retrospective effect which the AAIB had made, and which EASA was resisting, "would be very beneficial" (although he commented that his company was already acting in accordance with the recommendation at least for some components). <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">I am concerned that EASA does not intend making changes which would allow in-service helicopters to benefit from the proposed new CIVP requirements. (5) Guidance and minimum standards for the calculation of design load spectrums for non-structural critical parts In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team told the court that they had recommended that EASA amend CS 29.602 so as to provide guidance and set minimum standards for calculating design load spectrums for non-structural critical parts (like the duplex bearing which failed in this accident).</span> Under this recommendation, the standards would have to include highest individual operating loads and combination of dynamic operating loads, as well as the longest duration of exposure for such loads that could be experienced in operation. This was safety recommendation SR-2023-024. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">As [REDACTED] put it, this recommendation represented an attempt to ensure that the design process took into account what the AAIB had learned from this investigation.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">He acknowledged that major manufacturers would have procedures for considering design load spectrums for parts such as the bearing which failed in this case.</span> However, his concern was to have a comprehensive and uniform set of standards for such safety-critical parts. According to the latest information provided by the AAIB, EASA has issued a Certification Memorandum (CM)-RTS-003, which gives guidance on demonstration of compliance with applicable CS-27 and CS-29 requirements for hybrid bearings (i.e. bearings involving steel races and ceramic balls). EASA claims that this adequately addresses the findings from the accident. The AAIB does not consider this an adequate response. It points out that there is no guidance or requirement to calculate loads for non- structural critical parts (such as the tail rotor bearing), as distinct from a principal structural element (such as the entire tail rotor). It further notes that Certification Memorandum (CM)-RTS-003 focusses on issues with one type of bearing and does not address the broader issue raised by this recommendation. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">I am concerned that EASA has responded to this AAIB recommendation by citing action it has taken which does not appear to meet the AAIB's concerns. (6) Failure modes analysis at a system level In the inquests, the AAIB investigation team explained that they had recommended that EASA make amendments to requirements in CS-29 and to AMC in order to stress that, where potentially catastrophic failure modes are identified, the wider system should be reviewed for practical mitigation options, such as early warning systems and failure-tolerant design, rather than relying solely on statistical analysis to address the risk.</span> This was safety recommendation SR-2023-025. [REDACTED] explained that, in the present case, it may have been helpful to consider failure modes in relation to the tail rotor bearing and actuator as a single or conjoined system. He said that, if this had been done, "it may have been possible to mitigate the catastrophic nature of the tail rotor duplex bearing failure". He told the court that EASA's initial response to the recommendation had not covered any of the points the AAIB had raised and had not addressed the intent of the recommendation at all. He said that, after further engagement, EASA had given a more comprehensive reply which stated that Amendment 11 to CS-29 and the provision of guidance material sufficiently addressed the recommendation. However, [REDACTED] said that even that reply had quoted features of CS-29 which did not meet the requirements of the recommendation. There remained no provision for failure analysis to be conducted at a system level. In those circumstances, the AAIB assessed EASA's response to the recommendation as not being adequate. I am concerned that the AAIB's apparently sensible suggestion of requiring failure modes analysis to be conducted at a system level continues to be rejected. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe that each of EASA and the CAA have power to take such action. EASA has power to make regulatory changes and issue guidance as recommended by the AAIB under the various safety recommendations referenced above. These would affect helicopters in use in the UK at present and helicopters which may be in use in the UK in the future. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">Meanwhile, as [REDACTED] of the CAA told the court, the CAA has power to set certification specification requirements for helicopters which would affect the ability of a particular design of aircraft to be used in the UK.</span> Furthermore, the CAA has a role in seeking to work with EASA and other international regulator to secure appropriate action to improve safety. 7 YOUR RESPONSE A response to this report should be provided within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25 th July 2025.

Deceased name: Joel Ineson
Coroners name: David Place
Coroners Area: Sunderland
Category: Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths | Other related deaths
This report is being sent to: Health and Safety Executive | Department for Culture Media and Sport
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: SECRETARY OF STATE FOR CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE 1 CORONER I am David Place, His Majesty's Senior Coroner for the City of Sunderland 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 nd June 2023 I commenced an Investigation into the death of Mr Joel Kennth Ineson, who died at Hetton Lyons Park, Downs Pit Lane, Hetton-le-hole, Houghton-le-Spring on 1 st June 2023 aged 55 years. The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 4 th April 2025. I gave a conclusion of ‘Accident', and the medical cause of death having been revealed by the post-mortem examination, was confirmed as: - Ia Drowning Ib Diffuse Myocardial Scarring 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Joel Kenneth Ineson died at Hetton Lyons County Park on 1st June 2023 by drowning, having participated in an open water swimming event and suffering an unexpected cardiac event. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - Open Water Swimming is becoming a popular way of keeping fit. Mr Ineson was a keen participant in organised open water swimming events with safety at the forefront of his mind with a reasonable expectation that appropriate safety measures would be in place for an organised event. He attended such an event on 31 st May 2023 which was well attended, and the organisers indicated that this had been a popular event when it had taken place. This event, like many similar events, charged participants a small fee for the session. The matters of concern were not found to be causative of Mr Ineson's death but were such that there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: lack of knowledge">I was concerned that the evidence highlighted uncertainty and confusion with regard to responsibility for aspects of safety measures leading to some participants not receiving a specific safety briefing, a lack of knowledge of the competency/capability of each and every participant and no understanding as to who was in the water and how many people were in the water at any one time.</span> It became clear in evidence that the activity does not require a licence from the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority and can be undertaken and/or organised by anyone without regulation. Some organisations provide guidance on safety when organising such events, but there is no established UK body that provides regulation for this activity. It was confirmed there is no specific health and safety guidance, nor is there a regulatory compliance requirement regarding pre-session safety briefing, risk assessments, signing in and out of the water systems, emergency plans and/or training for organisers. The evidence indicated there is no oversight of these events which, by definition, take place in outdoor locations that may pose a risk. I shall be glad to be told of any learning arising from this death and timescales and results of your review. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 th June 2025. I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: - · Family · Sunderland City Council and their Solicitors · Springboard Sunderland Trust and their Solicitors · Organiser of water-based activity and their Solicitors I have also sent it to the following who may find it useful and of interest: The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner and all interested persons, who in my opinion should receive it, a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated this 10 th day of April 2025 Signature: HM Senior Coroner for the City of Sunderland

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED], Deputy Prime Minister & Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government 2 [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Home Department 1 CORONER I am Darren STEWART OBE, HM Area Coroner for the coroner area of Suffolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 08 August 2022 I commenced an investigation touching the death of Ruth Ann PINGREE aged 42. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion - Ruth Ann PINGREE was described by her family as an amazing person. Someone who had a quality about them that drew you to her with her smile, her laugh, her heart, her vulnerability and her brilliant mind. She was a person who would make you feel loved and valued and appreciated. A one in a million. A person who was always there for her family and friends and utterly devoted to her children. On the 22nd July 2022, Mrs. Pingree, her husband and two children travelled from their home in Surrey to Suffolk where they had planned to spend time with friends holidaying in a caravan park. There were about seven families in total who travelled separately to the Happy Days Retro Vacation caravan site in Saxmundham, Suffolk. The party arrived during the evening of the 22nd July 2022. The Happy Days Retro Vacation caravan site was comprised of seven Airstream caravans arranged around various outbuildings which provided shower and toilet facilities. The caravans were made from an aluminium outer skin built on a wooden frame and steel chassis. Each caravan was named. The caravan occupied by the Pingree family was called ‘Betsy'. On the evening they arrived Mr. Pingree had briefly watched parts of an online video prepared by Happy Days Retro Vacations and which was intended to orientate guests to the caravan they would occupy and how particular aspects of the caravan operated. The video did not include a safety brief nor did the Pingree's receive a safety brief on arrival at the Happy Days Retro Vacation site. The caravan ‘Betsy' was fitted with a dual smoke and carbon monoxide detector and which was fixed to a wall in the kitchen area of the caravan. In addition, a fire blanket was affixed to a wall near the stove in the kitchen area and a small fire extinguisher was also located in the kitchen area. Having arrived during the evening of Friday the 22nd July 2022, the Pingree's and their friends socialised outside near a fire pit before retiring for the evening. On Saturday the 23rd July 2022 the party enjoyed a day out travelling to Aldeburgh before returning later in the afternoon. As with the previous evening, the party socialised outside their caravans during the evening with the last person retiring at approximately 23:30 hours. As had been the case the previous evening, a fire pit had been used and several of the adult members of the group had smoked cigarettes. Adult members of the group had also consumed alcohol. A security check of the site by the owner at around 00:30 hours on the morning of the 24th July 2022 revealed nothing untoward with no sign of a fire other than a few glowing embers in the fire pit. The weather at the time had been exceptionally dry with above average (hotter) temperatures for the time of year. It was also windy on the evening of the 23rd July 2022. At some point approximately between 00:30 hours and 04:30 hours on the 24th July 2022 a smouldering fire started outside the bathroom end of the caravan ‘Betsy' which the Pingree's were occupying. It is not possible to say whether this was started from an ember blowing out of the fire pit or from a discarded match or cigarette butt. The fire was not started due to an electrical fault. The fire developed over a period of time engaging the external structure of the caravan. The effect of this development meant that the external aluminium cladding of the caravan heated causing the door frame of the sole caravan door to become warped and made the door inoperable; in effect jammed shut. At some time between 04:00 and 04:30 hours Mr. Pingree was woken by his son who alerted him to the fact that there was a fire. At this point there was smoke in the caravan and the fire had started to engage the inside of the bathroom end where the children had been sleeping. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment

Turning to the right and away from the door and facing his family who were in the kitchen area of the caravan, Mr. Pingree realised that quick action was required in order to escape the caravan. The fire was fully engaging the bathroom end of the caravan at this point and the entire space had quickly become full of acrid dark smoke. Mr. Pingree then used his body to force open the window above the sink in the kitchen area and climbed outside. He was followed by his two children. Mrs. Pingree had remained to assist the children in their escape. Her actions in doing so meant that the children were able to escape the burning caravan. Sadly Mrs. Pingree was not able to escape the caravan and shortly after the second child escaped, the caravan became engulfed in fire and smoke. Desperate efforts to extinguish the fire by those present were unsuccessful and it was not until the Fire Service arrived at 04:45 hours that the fire was finally extinguished. By this point Mrs. Pingree had sadly perished in the fire. Had the fire alarm functioned it is likely that this would have been before the Pingree's son had raised the alarm. It is not possible however to say if this would have meant Mrs. Pingree would have escaped the caravan before being overcome by the fire fumes. A postmortem examination of Mrs. Pingree's body established that her medical cause of death was due to the inhalation of fire fumes. Investigation of the cause of the fire established that the source of the fire was not due to an electrical fault, but rather either an ember blowing from a nearby fire pit or a discarded cigarette/match. This caused a smouldering fire to develop over a period of time outside the caravan and which then engulfed the caravan. Ruth Ann PINGREE died as a result of the effects of a fire in a caravan she was holidaying in and which started due to accidental causes. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a. Inhalation of fire fumes 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH See Narrative Conclusion above 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The Inquest heard evidence concerning the operation of the Regulatory Reform Fire Safety Order 2005 (FSO). In assessing the actions by owners/proprietors of businesses such as Happy Days Retro Vacations for compliance with the FSO, there is a general test of suitability and sufficiency applied in relation to measures undertaken by the relevant responsible person/entity (proprietors) to comply with the FSO. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Safety Culture
Keywords: safety notices">This does not require that the proprietors: . keep any written records; . set a specific interval of maintenance inspections; or . provide any signage or safety notices in caravans indicating escape routes or actions in case of emergency.</span> There would not appear to be any set guidance or format for the conduct of a risk assessment, what this must cover nor how often they should be conducted. Proprietors, who under the FSO, are responsible for carrying out risk assessments are provided within the FSO with a general set of requirements that need to then be considered as to applicability to any given activity. The means to understand and interpret the requirement is reliant upon the research ability of those charged with undertaking the risk assessment. Guidance documents such as the Paying Guest Guide do exist and outline best practice steps, however these are not included in the FSO as minimum standards a responsible person/entity is required to take. The potential for short cuts and misunderstandings are substantial. This is within a framework of assurance and enforcement that would appear to be ad hoc. This is in the context of businesses providing accommodation to the public on a paid basis. There is a lack of clear standards concerning what fire safety measures are required, how to assess what is to be applied, how to achieve that standard, and the assurance and enforcement mechanisms beyond this. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by June 02, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] (Husband) (via legal representatives) [REDACTED] (Mother) [REDACTED] (Sister) Happy Days Retro Vacations Ltd. (via legal representatives) Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service (via legal representatives) East Suffolk Council (via legal representatives) I have also sent it to The National Fire Chiefs Council who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 08/04/2025 Darren STEWART OBE HM Area Coroner for Suffolk

Ref: 2025-0159
Deceased name: Peter Konitzer
Coroners name: Nicholas Rheinberg
Coroners Area: Wiltshire & Swindon
Category: Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths
This report is being sent to: Health and Safety Executive
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Health and Safety Executive 1 CORONER I am Nicholas Leslie Rheinberg assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Wiltshire & Swindon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 th September 2016 an inquest was opened into the death of Peter David Konitzer aged 63. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 st March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Peter David Konitzer died on 24 th August 2016 as a result of compression of the chest. The jury concluded that the deceased had been unlawfully killed. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Peter David Konitzer worked as a volunteer for Wilts & Berks Canal Trust in relation to a project to rehabilitate the top lock of the Wilts and Berks canal at Pewsham. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: outside the experience">The work involved elements of heavy construction outside the experience and capabilities of the volunteer workforce employed.</span> Senior management of the canal trust failed to manage the project in an efficient and legally compliant manner partly through ignorance of their legal responsibilities. Mr Konitzer died when removing props behind a recently excavated retaining wall which collapsed onto him. As a result of senior management failures to manage the project in a manner so as to preserve the safety of those involved in the execution of the works the trust was prosecuted and pleaded guilty. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: design">There appeared to be lack of understanding by the trust of the legal obligations set by the Construction Design Management Regulations and little appreciation of relevant standards and guidance such as are to be found by reference to British Standards and HSE Guidance.</span> In particular there was ignorance of the requirement for temporary works designs, risk assessments and method statements and the need to have completed full designs, project identification documents, construction phase plans, including health and safety plans and risk assessments, prior to starting work. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. The HSE website has a section on Volunteering which provides links to more detailed sections elsewhere on the website. No where is it emphasised that as a matter of good practice before undertaking any construction work risk assessments and method statements should be in writing even when there is no legal requirement to do so. Many charitable trusts have a large number of volunteers working for them but with under 5 actual employees technically escape the legal requirements for such documents to be in writing. 2. Subsequent to the conviction of the Canal Trust for breaches of health and safety legislation the HSE published a bulletin. Will consideration be given to publishing a further bulletin following the finding of the inquest jury that Peter Konitzer was unlawfully killed? Such a bulletin might serve as a stark warning to others embarking on similar projects. 3. Will thought be given to revising the Volunteering section of the website to provide a more comprehensive and standalone guide to the obligations of charitable trusts and voluntary organisations? Might such revision profitably include a section reminding organisations that rely on volunteers that enthusiasm should be tempered by being mindful of the need to obtain proper professional advice and assistance in appropriate circumstances? 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 st May 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the deceased's family and the Wilts & Berks Canal Trust. I have also sent it to the Inland Waterways Association and the Canal & River Trust who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 25 th March 2025 N.L.Rheinberg Assistant Coroner

This report is being sent to: Home Office | Surrey County Council
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], The Secretary of State for the Home Department [REDACTED], The Chief Executive Officer of Surrey County Council 1 CORONER Richard Travers HM Senior Coroner for Surrey 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners and Justice Act 2009. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST The inquest into the death of Natasha Johnston was heard and concluded on the 21 st October 2024. The medical cause of Ms Johnston's death was: 1a: Shock and Haemorrhage including Perforation of the Left Jugular Vein 1b: Multiple Penetrating Dog Bites to Neck, Arms and Torso 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In the early afternoon of the 12 th January 2023, Ms Johnston was walking some eight dogs in the area of the ‘Viewpoint', Gravelly Hill, Caterham, Surrey. The dogs ranged dramatically both in size and weight, from small to very large. She was in the habit of acting as a dog walker and had walked these same dogs on previous occasions without difficulty. Between approximately 14:00 hours and 15:00 hours she was seen in the area, by a number of different people. Initially, she appeared to be in control of the dogs, but as time went by, the dogs became increasingly excited and out of her control. At one point she was seen by another dog walker with a large group of dogs. He had seen her before with a lot of dogs and, as before, on seeing him she immediately turned around called the dogs and went in the opposite direction with the dogs following. Another person, who was out exercising, saw her with a large number of dogs. He stood to one side to allow her to pass and one of the larger dogs jumped up at him and put its paws on his chest, albeit causing him no harm. At another point, two riders came across her, at that time she was sat on the floor surrounded by a group of dogs, their leads were all tangled up. She shouted, ‘go back, go back'. The dogs were not attacking her, but they were out of control. Two of them ran towards the horses frightening them and causing one of them to bolt with the result that its rider was thrown to the ground. After this, one of the larger dogs, began worrying a smaller dog that was being walked by its owner. On picking up her dog, the owner was then bitten in her left buttock, by this dog, causing her severe pain and injury. By the time of the last two encounters, the dogs were no longer in Ms Johnston's control. A short while later, another walker's attention was drawn, by a fellow walker, to a large number of dogs that were all off their leads and causing a commotion. On going to investigate he saw an object at the bottom of a nearby very steep slope. He descended the slope to see two of the dogs with blood on their muzzles in the vicinity of the object, which, as he approached, he recognised to be the body of a woman, this was Ms Johnson. Despite the aggressive stance of the dogs, he approached Ms Johnston, who was covered in blood and had suffered a large number of puncture wounds. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">He could not find any signs of life, but called the ambulance service and, under their instruction, began CPR on Ms Johnston.</span> Despite his attempts and those of two police officers and a paramedic, Ms Johnston remained unresponsive. Ms Johnston's death was recognised at 15:29 that same day; she had died from her wounds. It was clear that she had been the subject of a vicious dog attack by an unknown number of dogs, which had formed part of the group of eight dogs that she had been walking that day. The post mortem examination revealed that she had sustained multiple injuries consistent with dog bites and claw marks. The concentration of bite marks was particularly severe around the neck. They had led to the penetration of the jugular vein, which in itself would have been fatal. However, the remaining bite marks would also have led to catastrophic haemorrhage which would also have resulted in her death. There were no other injuries that could have caused or contributed to death. Whilst, when she was first seen, Ms Johnston appeared to have some control over the dogs, it was readily apparent that as time went by that any such control was lost, eventually with a tragic result. Bearing in mind the sheer number and size of the dogs involved, her inability to control and to hold them was not surprising. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES I have sent a copy of this report to the following Interested Persons in the Inquest and to the Chief Coroner. 1.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held before a Jury on 12 th July 2024. The conclusion of the jury was that: Jason Vaughan Holland was an experienced self-employed electrician. On the 10 th February 2023 he was working at the Mercia Park site when he was found entrapped between a scissor lift and ladder racking at a height of approximately 20 metres. As a result of this he suffered a cardiac arrest which resulted in an unsurvivable brain injury. Jason passed away at the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham. Jason unintentionally activated the platform raising function instead of the drive function. The Jury returned a conclusion of accidental death. The cause of death was established as: I a Hypoxic Brain Injury. I b Traumatic Cardiac Arrest I c II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jason Holland had been sub contracted to work on a construction site at Mercia Park at the fit out stage for the purposes of installing cabling within containment. 90% of the work to be carried out was working at height. The height of the Unit was 20 metres high. The Unit was 100,00 m2. Mr Holland was an experienced electrician of over 20 years. He held his IPAF card. On 10 th February 2023, whilst working on a scissor lift at a height of 20 meters, undertaking tie wrapping of armoured cable in containment tray which had been laid in the roof space, he became trapped between the scissor lift railing and the containment tray. The scissor lift could not be lowered from ground level, as Mr Holland was positioned over the rail and any movement could have caused him to fall 20 meters to the floor. Operatives from the principal contractor on site, and sub contractors had to carry out a basket to basket rescue of Mr Holland. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Paramedics were on the scene at the point Mr Holland was lowered on the scissor lift. He was in cardiac arrest but paramedics were able to establish a return of spontaneous circulation. Mr Holland went into cardiac arrest for a second time, and again paramedics were able to establish a return of spontaneous circulation. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) I heard from a number of organisations within the construction and electrical industry and self employed trades persons. I heard that the industry recognised standard within construction for individuals being assessed as competent to operate a mobile elevated working platforms (MEWPs) is IPAF (International Powered Access Federation) whereby individuals undergo a one day course to be assessed as competent to operate a cherry picker/boom lift (3a) or scissor lifts (3b). I understand that there are a number of training providers nationally who run the course but that the syllabus is set by IPAF. Operatives who pass the course are issued with an IPAF card which is renewed every 5 years. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: trained">As part of the course, I understand that operatives are classroom trained and then practically assessed operating the necessary MEWPs.</span> Whilst the theory touches upon rescue at height scenarios (albeit having seen the syllabus it deals with potential falls from heights not entrapment). It does not include practical training on rescue at height scenarios or basket to basket rescues drills as standard. I heard evidence of the challenges that the organisations had found in sourcing a practical drill based course for at an height rescue. All operatives I heard from working for a range of trades had their IPAF cards and not one had ever received practical training of at height rescue. They all told me that they had received theory based training only. I heard evidence that time is of the essence. For example in a suspension from a harness type scenario (not Jason's case) between 5 and 15 minutes could be the difference between life or death. The same however can be said for someone who is suffering from positional asphyxia because they are trapped. I am therefore concerned to note that practical based rescue drills are not part of the standard competence based training offered for those operating these machines who are likely to be first on site facilitating rescues. Whilst Mr Holland's case concerned the construction industry and the assessment of competency of operating MEWPs through IPAF, I understand that all of those organisations identified operate within their relevant sectors as IPAF does for the construction industry and MEWP operating competency based courses follow a similar syllabus, without any practical rescue from height drills being offered as standard. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6 th September 2024 . I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The Family of Mr Holland WinVic Construction Ltd Walter Miles Electrical Engineers Ltd Direct Electrical (Leics) Ltd I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 12/07/2024 Miss F BUTLER His Majesty's Assistant Coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire

        Date of report: 18/7/2024
Ref: 2024-0385
Deceased name: Tony Williams
Coroner name: Jacqueline Devonish
Coroner Area: Cheshire
Category: Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths This report is being sent to: Health and Safety Executive
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Health and Safety Executive 1 CORONER I am Jacqueline DEVONISH, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cheshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Tony WILLIAMS aged 45. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was a Misadventure. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 2 December 2020, Tony Williams, an HGV driver for [REDACTED] , was delivering bales of hay to [REDACTED] in Cheshire. Thirty-three hay bales were loaded onto the 45ft HGV at [REDACTED] in Suffolk by the farm director in the presence of Mr Williams, who was experienced in the strapping and loading of Hesston bales. Three bales were loaded width ways, the opposite direction to the rest of the bales, on the back end of the vehicle. On the journey from Suffolk, somewhere along the route an ANPR camera had caught an image of hay overhanging the back of the vehicle. When arriving at [REDACTED], with the assistance of a banksman, Mr Williams reversed down [REDACTED] a public domain road with a known slope comparable to a wheelchair ramp. Mr Williams was witnessed by a Farmhand unstrapping the load when the three width ways bales fell from the back. Two of which fell on top of Mr Williams. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: ambulance">When the ambulance arrived advanced life saving measures were administered to no avail.</span> He was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:01 hours. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The configurations for safely loading bales widthways, on a slope of 4.5 degrees and utilising crisscross strapping were considered in evidence. HSE produced laser measurements and images identifying the centre of gravity and risks associated with unloading overhanging bales on a slope when the most rearward bales are loaded widthways. HSE concluded that the accident would not have occurred if Mr Williams had not unloaded with the overhang facing downhill. It became apparent that there were no clear images in the guidance or support materials produced by HSE to assist drivers who load and unload bales. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 10, 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons I have also sent it to Mr William's family, Liverpool University, [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 18/07/2024 Jacqueline DEVONISH Senior Coroner for Cheshire

The conclusion of the inquest was that: Misadventure 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Michael Harrison was a driver for a scaffolding firm. On 26 February 2021 he was working at Victoria Mills, Macclesfield Road, Holmes Chapel. Whilst unloading scaffolding from a Hiab truck the Hiab arm (a crane-like device) came down on him, causing crushing injuries which proved fatal. The jury found that he was wearing the remote control over his head and across his chest causing the inadvertent movement of the crane arm. The remote control had not been isolated during the unloading activity 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

Ref: 2024-0317
Deceased name: Graham Faulkner
Coroner name: Elizabeth Wheeler
Coroner Area: Cheshire
Category: Accident at Work and Health and Safety related deaths This report is being sent to: Health and Safety Executive
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief executive - Health and Safety Executive 1 CORONER I am Elizabeth WHEELER, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Cheshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 03 April 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Graham FAULKNER aged 64. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 31 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: "Mr Faulkner died as a result of medical complications arising from an accident at work some years previously. This was contributed to by failures in the administration and management of the Permit to Work process and a lack of challenge, at all levels, around the use of PPE." 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In October 2015 Mr Faulkner was exposed to caustic soda at work. Mr Faulkner was hospitalised approximately week later, in a serious condition. Within a month, his paraplegia had started. He was not discharged from hospital until 2017. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: exposure to">He died in 2019 from the sequalae of his original injury ie exposure to caustic soda. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Summary : The absence any prompt investigation by the HSE to establish the relevant facts and potential gaps in process could have an impact upon the ability to learn from one death and so avoid other deaths. Further detail The incident occurred on 15 October 2015. The employer became aware of the incident shortly after 22 October 2015, but initially had limited details. The HSE were informed of the incident in early November 2015. The RIDDOR report to the HSE noted "Injury preventing the injured person from working for more than 7 days". Separate email correspondence to the HSE at around the same time informed the HSE that Mr Faulkner was in the ICU. By 4 November 2015, Mr Faulkner had developed paraplegia from the consequences of his initial injuries. Despite it being known to the HSE that Mr Faulkner had suffered some form of injury with serious consequences (ie ICU admission), the HSE did not investigate. Their records do not show a specific reason for this, but I am informed it did not meet the selection criteria. The selection criteria are dated 2014 and are still in place today. These 2014 criteria include incidents which engage the reporting requirements in RIDDOR 4(1). None of these criteria apply to Mr Faulkner. The investigation criteria does not include the criteria in RIDDOR 4(2) - namely "Where any person at work is incapacitated for routine work for more than seven consecutive days (excluding the day of the accident) because of an injury resulting from an accident arising out of or in connection with that work, ... ." It is unclear why the 2014 selection criteria apply to RIDDOR 4(1) and not to 4(2), when both engage statutory reporting criteria. It is unclear why the criteria in RIDDOR 4(1) do not include injuries resulting in paraplegia, given the life changing severity of such injuries. If the reason the 2014 selection criteria are relatively narrowly drafted is to avoid excessive expansion of the HSE's duties, it is unclear why there is not a "discretionary" criteria which would allow for investigations where the known facts would suggest that an investigation would be appropriate in accordance with the HSE's wider statutory functions and purpose. As a result of the HSE decision not to investigate in 2015, various evidence was either not obtained or is no longer in existence. The first witness statement accounts from many eye witnesses date to 2021 or 2022 - some 5 years or more after the events in question. This has meant that it is challenging to establish the facts that led to Mr Faulkner's injury. Issues that have been in dispute in the evidence have included when the exposure took place, where it took place, the PPE he was wearing and the instructions as to PPE on the permit to work. It is likely that many of these issues would be factually clear(er) if evidence had been obtained in 2015, shortly after the incident, when memories were fresher and various paperwork still in existence. The absence of any or any prompt investigation by the HSE to establish the relevant facts and potential gaps in process could have an impact upon the ability to learn from one death and so avoid other deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by July 26, 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Mr Faulkner's family Industrial Chemicals Ltd ("ICL") who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 13/06/2024 Elizabeth WHEELER Assistant Coroner for Cheshire
