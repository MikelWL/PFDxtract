REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS This report is being sent to: Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Chief Constable of Surrey College of Policing 1 CORONER I am Robert Sowersby, Assistant Coroner for Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST On 28 June 2023 my office commenced an investigation into the death of Amy Anne Levy.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 6 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">The conclusion of the jury who heard the inquest was - ‘ Amy took a deliberate overdose of prescription drugs on 18 th June 2023.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">It is not possible to know her true intent. ' Police were notified at the time of her overdose but Amy's whereabouts were unknown: much of the evidence in the inquest centred on their attempts to find her address so that emergency services could be sent to help her.</span> This was an article 2 inquest, and in recording how Amy died the jury identified ‘ a catalogue of missed opportunities to obtain Amy's correct address ' by various bodies including Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The jury also concluded that if not for those missed opportunities Amy would probably have survived. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH At the time of her death Amy was a 22-year-old student at the University of the West of England (UWE), living at a term-time address in Bristol.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">While she was in Bristol (on 18 June 2023) she called a friend, took an overdose of prescription drugs, and then steadily deteriorated while remaining on the phone - initially becoming unresponsive and later appearing to stop breathing.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">Surrey Police were informed of the situation via a 999 call.</span> In the ensuing period of over 2 hours before Amy was found Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary both tried to obtain her correct address. As part of that effort calls were made by police (i) to Amy's family home in Surrey, and (ii) to her mother's mobile phone. Each call came through with ‘no caller ID' and went unanswered. Both police forces knew that Amy had taken an overdose at an unknown address and that her condition was deteriorating. Both forces had graded Amy's case as requiring an ‘immediate' response (the most urgent category). Despite that factual background, none of the officers or call handlers who phoned Amy's parents left a voicemail message. Having missed the call/s (from an unknown source or sources) Amy's parents did not know that there was an emergency, or that the police wanted to speak with them, and had no way of calling back whoever had called them. It is probable that Amy's location could have been obtained earlier than it was if the police had left a suitably worded voicemail for one or more of her parents. Amy died in hospital on 22 June 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

This report is being sent to: Cornwall Council
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Cornwall Council 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22/5/25, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who died on 20/1/24 at the age of 32.</span> I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries. I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD. He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed.</span> In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol.</span> In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen.</span> He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: safety + mental health + mental health">He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment.</span> He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum's risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention. Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge.</span> Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence, it is more likely than not that Callum has jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + guidance + guidance + mental health">At inquest, the court heard from Gail Ashton who was the AMHP involved in the mental health act assessment conducted overnight on 19 & 20 January 2024. 1) One issue that arose was whether Callum presented with an imminent and significant risk of harm to justify a short-term admission into hospital as is provided for in NICE guidance.</span> Ms Ashton said this was expressly discussed by the clinicians concerned. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: facilities">It was felt he was likely to be withdrawing and there were no resuscitation facilities available in Longreach.</span> She also said the vulnerabilities of others on the ward needed to be considered all of which contributed to the decision not to detain Callum in hospital. She accepted that this rationale was not recorded in the notes. 2) Callum was asked whether he wanted his mother (who he described as his rock) notified of his discharge. He said that he did not. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">This was not tested or challenged where GMC guidance is that it may be appropriate to do so.</span> The Nearest Relative details on the MH 1 form were not completed. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: gaps + team + record + team">The expert who reviewed the case felt there were ‘obvious gaps' in the record keeping and that as Callum's mother was one of the few levers available to the assessing team, Callum's decision not to involve her should have been explored further.</span> You may feel these omissions should be learned from when assessments are conducted in the future and, in particular, when notes of an assessment are subsequently recorded. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25.7.25. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: [REDACTED], mother [REDACTED], father and step-mother Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust Sanctuary Housing I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shaun Michael Bass aged 23.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 August 2022. The medical cause of death was determined to be; 1a. [REDACTED] toxicity. I returned a short form conclusion that Shaun Michael Bass died as the result of suicide. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction. Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: treatment + care + care + medical history">This report is being published following updates from Greater Manchester Police and suicide prevention organisations received on the 14th of March 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a medical history that included persistent and enduring anxiety and depressive disorders that had required previous inpatient phases of treatment and care but had recently been treated and managed conservatively in the community.</span> On the 23rd of February 2020, the deceased was discovered collapsed and unresponsive in his residence at [REDACTED], Bolton having ingested a significant quantity of [REDACTED] that he had acquired earlier in the month from an internet-based company licensed to sell reportable poisons. He was verified as dead and beyond further attempted resuscitation by attending paramedics. From within the premises, police recovered a note of intent recently handwritten by the deceased and empty packaging labelled "[REDACTED] - Extra Pure 99.9% 50g" - for meat curing" the deceased had sourced via accessing a website promoting and sanctioning self-harm by means of [REDACTED] poisoning. Post-mortem samples were analysed and confirmed the deceased had recently ingested a significant and fatally toxic quantity of [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

[REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Sourcing such poisons/chemicals/medications in the UK and abroad. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 16, 2025.
