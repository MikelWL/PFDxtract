On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: between + between">Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall.</span> The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46. On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">EMAS advised the family member that the incident had been logged as a Category 3 response, and that there was an 8 hour wait for an ambulance.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">At 00:33 a member of Kaine's family called the police to report their concerns.</span> A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle. During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance.</span> He arrived at 03:47. Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: This PFD should be read in conjunction with the PFD that I issued mid-inquest, dated 17 July 2025. 1. Lack of joint agency policy/cross-sector working on Acute Behavioural Disorder/Disturbance In September 2022, the Royal College of Psychiatrists issued a position statement on Acute Behavioural Disturbance and Excited Delirium. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: between + between">Lack of agreed joint agency policy between EMAS and the police on s.136 MHA 1983 detentions I issued a PFD on 17 July 2025, part way through the final inquest hearing, to raise my concern over the apparent confusion with both the police and EMAS as to the applicable joint agency policy dealing with s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance.</span> Since that PFD was issued, the evidence has developed and the position at the end of the inquest was as follows: - The police confirmed that the document titled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" has been ratified within their organisation and continues to remain the relevant joint-agency policy for s.136 detention and conveyance. This policy has been implemented for the police since its inception. - EMAS cannot confirm whether the above policy has been ratified in its current version within the organisation. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">They have confirmed that an employee at EMAS signed off on the 2021 version, but that this information was never disseminated within the organisation because the finalised version of the policy remained within that employee's email inbox.</span> The consequence appears to be that EMAS has never implemented this policy, rather they have been working to an internal policy for Mental Health Conveyance that contains different working standards. Acknowledging that there is no confusion for the police as to the relevant policy, and that they do consider that it has been implemented, I remain concerned. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

EMAS have allowed a situation to perpetuate in which they appear, on the face of the policy documents, to be party to an agreement (which includes service level agreements for conveyance) when they simply do not know if this is correct. The upshot of this is that other agencies may be placing reliance on the conveyance terms within the policy when they are dealing with s.136 detention. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The medical cause of death was 1a Hanging. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest On 20th November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED].

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Keywords: training + manager + training + training">I was informed by a senior manager of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust that with the translation of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust into the new Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that issue of training is being addressed.</span> However it emerged at the inquest that there do not appear to be any firm plans to train agency staff. Agency staff form a significant percentage of frontline staff. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors

Moreover, in 2021 a report commissioned by NHS England into Southern Health Foundation Trust similarly reported on shortfall in communication with families.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + communication + monitoring + mental health">Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review guidelines and procedures concerning communication with family and friends of patients with mental health difficulties by its permanent and agency staff, and monitoring of whether such communication has taken place. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 18, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Keywords: mental health + access, quality + communication + higher + between, staff + between, staff + mental health + training + training + training + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments. (2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Patryk's next of kin. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Priya Malhotra 18 July 2025

(2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</td>

The final inquest hearing started on 30 June 2025 and is due to conclude on 25 July 2025. The evidence is currently ongoing. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kaine was a 26-year-old male with a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and a history of substance misuse. On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: resource">A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'.</span> Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle.</span> During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency.

Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest.

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: areas">I acknowledge that the North London NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) has made progress in addressing some areas of concern the Trust identified during their own internal investigation, and that is to be commended.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Post-Event Learning and Improvement
Keywords: improvement plan">However, there remain some matters of concern that do not appear to have been addressed and the evidence also revealed other matters that have not been identified in the Trust's improvement plan.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: clear + staff + staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) Record Keeping / Professional Standards There was evidence that staff on Topaz Ward would sometimes use the ID card of another member of staff to makes notes on the records system, without making it clear who the entry was actually made by.</span> In this case there were two entries that appeared to have been made by a support worker, that were actually made by a nurse. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Such misleading and inaccurate record keeping risks significant confusion in the provision of care and potentially creates significant risk in relation to the continuity of care. 2) Lack of Professional Curiosity / Therapeutic Engagement - Audits This was a matter picked up during the Trust's own investigation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy + policy">The Trust's action plan includes audits to monitor compliance with certain aspects of Trust policy etc.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Supervision and Leadership
Keywords: manager">However, the Topaz Ward manager gave evidence that there had been issues with audits in the past, which had been escalated (prior to Ms Crane's death) but no response received.</span> I was not reassured that further audits would be sufficient to address the concerns already identified. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">In addition to the above, numerous members of staff from Topaz Ward gave evidence during the inquest and it appeared that many of them struggled with the concept of ‘therapeutic engagement'.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Some maintained that Ms Crane had received a sufficient level of therapeutic engagement from Ward staff, contrary to the findings of the Trust's own investigation and the subsequent findings of the jury.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: mental health + care + needs + care">This suggests a potentially widespread lack of understanding, and underlying knowledge of ‘therapeutic engagement' and its importance in mental health care. 3) Step down / discharge from PICU to acute ward There was evidence that the Trust's systems were unable to accommodate the needs of Ms Crane in ensuring that her transition from an intensive care to an acute setting was as safe as possible for her.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + needs + care + staff + staff">Numerous risks and needs were identified for the step down / discharge process, but most of these (which significantly impacted Ms Crane's risk to self) were not facilitated. 4) Therapeutic Engagement / Professional Curiosity - Generally The jury heard evidence from numerous members of Topaz Ward staff who were taken through the care records, that Ms Crane had become withdrawn from around 12 September 2024 onwards.</span> Many of the witnesses denied this, despite the evidence to the contrary. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: factor + factor + staff + staff + factor">The fact of Ms Crane becoming withdrawn had been identified by staff in PICU as a significant risk factor for Ms Crane.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff, patient">While this may not have been picked up by all staff due to record keeping issues (already identified by the Trust), the concern here is that there appears to have been a general inability among staff to recognise when a patient is becoming withdrawn, which raises concern about underlying professional curiosity. 5) Observations on Topaz Ward The Trust's own internal investigation highlighted issues regarding the review of required observation levels.</span> However, the evidence at inquest, in relation to the observation round at or about 11:30 on 19 September raised a further concern, albeit this did not cause / contribute to Ms Crane's death in the particular circumstances. The evidence was that the support worker conducting this check did not see any part of Ms Crane, and on trying to open the door noted there was some resistance. As such, the assumption was made that Ms Crane was sat with her back to the door, and the support worker marked Ms Crane as being in her room and moved on to the next room. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: policy + communication + between staff, between, staff + between, staff + culture + policy + training">This raises the concern that observations being undertaken do not always comply with the Trust's own observation policy and that there may be a staff training / knowledge gap in this regard. 6) Communication and Culture While the Trust's internal investigation highlighted issues with documentation and record keeping, which is key tool for communication, the evidence revealed a lack of general communication between staff at all levels.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety + care + care + communication + patient">Aside from documentation matters, a lack of good communication more generally raises significant patient care risks and could undermine patient safety.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">The substantive consultant psychiatrist for Topaz Ward said that they would change nothing about the care that was provided.</span> This raises concerns that the senior clinician for the Ward does not accept or appreciate the issues identified by the Trust. 7) Trust Action Plan Some of the matters contained within the Trust's action plan, which stems from its own internal investigation, remain outstanding and / or are still awaiting Board level approval. As such, there is, to some extent, a lack of reassurance (at present) regarding the actions that will actually be taken to address the risks the Trust itself has already identified. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of the report, namely by 18 August 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of actions taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: quality + care + information + care">Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following: Ms Crane's family; and The Care Quality Commission, for information.</span> I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Ian Potter HM Assistant Coroner, Inner North London 23 June 2025

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS This report is being sent to: Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Chief Constable of Surrey College of Policing 1 CORONER I am Robert Sowersby, Assistant Coroner for Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST On 28 June 2023 my office commenced an investigation into the death of Amy Anne Levy.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 6 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

' Police were notified at the time of her overdose but Amy's whereabouts were unknown: much of the evidence in the inquest centred on their attempts to find her address so that emergency services could be sent to help her.</span> This was an article 2 inquest, and in recording how Amy died the jury identified ‘ a catalogue of missed opportunities to obtain Amy's correct address ' by various bodies including Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: informed">Surrey Police were informed of the situation via a 999 call.</span> In the ensuing period of over 2 hours before Amy was found Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary both tried to obtain her correct address. As part of that effort calls were made by police (i) to Amy's family home in Surrey, and (ii) to her mother's mobile phone. Each call came through with ‘no caller ID' and went unanswered. Both police forces knew that Amy had taken an overdose at an unknown address and that her condition was deteriorating. Both forces had graded Amy's case as requiring an ‘immediate' response (the most urgent category). Despite that factual background, none of the officers or call handlers who phoned Amy's parents left a voicemail message. Having missed the call/s (from an unknown source or sources) Amy's parents did not know that there was an emergency, or that the police wanted to speak with them, and had no way of calling back whoever had called them. It is probable that Amy's location could have been obtained earlier than it was if the police had left a suitably worded voicemail for one or more of her parents. Amy died in hospital on 22 June 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

It is hard to understand the decision (made by more than one police caller) not to leave any voicemail/message. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: concerns + guidance + policy + guidance + policy">We heard evidence from two police Inspectors (one from Avon and Somerset Constabulary and one from Surrey Police) that although there is guidance in Avon not to leave voicemails when the incident in question concerns domestic abuse, there is no general guidance about when to leave a voicemail message in other cases ( ie , it is neither encouraged not discouraged by any policy or standard operating procedure).</span> I was subsequently provided with an updated ‘ Deployment of Resources Procedure ' from Surrey Police, which indicates that ‘ call takers and dispatchers must consider whether it is appropriate to leave a voicemail, unless there is a compelling operational reason not to do so '. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action: otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Amy Levy's family. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete, redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 May 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Cornwall Council 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22/5/25, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who died on 20/1/24 at the age of 32.</span> I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries. I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD. He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed.</span> In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol.</span> In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen.</span> He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: safety + mental health + mental health">He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment.</span> He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum's risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention. Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge.</span> Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence, it is more likely than not that Callum has jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + guidance + guidance + mental health">At inquest, the court heard from Gail Ashton who was the AMHP involved in the mental health act assessment conducted overnight on 19 & 20 January 2024. 1) One issue that arose was whether Callum presented with an imminent and significant risk of harm to justify a short-term admission into hospital as is provided for in NICE guidance.</span> Ms Ashton said this was expressly discussed by the clinicians concerned. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: facilities">It was felt he was likely to be withdrawing and there were no resuscitation facilities available in Longreach.</span> She also said the vulnerabilities of others on the ward needed to be considered all of which contributed to the decision not to detain Callum in hospital. She accepted that this rationale was not recorded in the notes. 2) Callum was asked whether he wanted his mother (who he described as his rock) notified of his discharge. He said that he did not. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

Deceased name: Callum Hargreaves
Coroners name: Andrew Cox
Coroners Area: Cornwall and Isles of Scilly
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | Suicide (from 2015) | Mental Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly ICB
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Medical Officer, NHS Cornwall and IoS ICB. 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22/5/25, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who died on 20/1/24 at the age of 32.</span> I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries. I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD. He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed.</span> In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol.</span> In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen.</span> He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: safety + mental health + assessment">He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment.</span> He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk, assessment">Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum's risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention.</span> Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge.</span> Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Ref: 2025-0261
Deceased name: Callum Hargreaves
Coroners name: Andrew Cox
Coroners Area: Cornwall and Isles of Scilly
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | Suicide (from 2015) | Mental Health related deaths
This report is being sent to: Cornwall Council
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Head of Housing Options, Cornwall Council 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22/5/25, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who died on 20/1/24 aged 32.</span> I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries. I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD. He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed.</span> In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol.</span> In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen.</span> He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: safety + mental health">He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment.</span> He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum's risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention. Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge.</span> Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence, it is more likely than not that Callum has jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Biases and stereotyping + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: providers + providers">On the facts of this case, Callum had a social tenancy with Sanctuary Housing but it is recognised the Council will have professional relationships with a number of housing providers.</span> Safeguarding alerts were raised that Callum was being cuckooed. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">There was then a ‘stand-off' between Sanctuary and the Council as to who had responsibility for housing Callum.</span> This was not resolved even though there were seven Safeguarding conferences held over half a year. It was felt by the Chair of the Safeguarding conferences that Callum had been failed and that the question of who was responsible for his accommodation should have been resolved much more quickly. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Biases and stereotyping + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: providers + concerns + providers">Going forward, the Council may wish to reflect upon: - How it would like social housing providers with whom it has professional relationships to resolve concerns about the cuckooing of tenants.</span> A separate Preventing Future Deaths report has been written to Sanctuary in this regard (with a copy sent to the Council); - How disagreements about who has responsibility for housing a cuckooed tenant who becomes effectively homeless may be resolved more rapidly; - Council witnesses held conflicting views as to whether a social tenancy disqualified a tenant from making a homelessness application. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">It is for the Council to decide how to ensure a consistent approach is taken by its staff.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: situation">The situation generally is considered in greater detail at paragraphs 150- 160 of the attached judgement. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24.7.25.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: - [REDACTED], mother - [REDACTED], father and step-mother - Sanctuary Housing - Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response.

This report is being sent to: Sanctuary Housing
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Sanctuary Housing 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22 May 2025, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who was found deceased on 20/1/24 at the age of 32. I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues

Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence, I found it was more likely than not that Callum had jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) Callum had a flat at Silverdale Court in Newquay that was provided by Sanctuary Housing. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From circa 2020, there were concerns that he was being cuckooed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: concerns + information">A new Housing officer was appointed in mid-2022 and was made aware of these concerns although information from the police was that Callum had invited others into the flat.</span> The Officer tried to speak to Callum who proved evasive. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The Officer was surprised when a survey conducted in mid-2023 revealed over £10,000 damage, that the flat was uninhabitable and likely had been for some time.</span> This gave rise to the question of who would accommodate Callum going forward. The issue was discussed at seven Safeguarding conferences. Sanctuary Housing agreed to provide Callum with decant accommodation out of goodwill but there was a lengthy period when Callum was homeless and sleeping rough. The issue of whether Callum was being cuckooed or not appeared not to have been determined while he was alive. At inquest, it was established he had been. The issue of who had caused the damage at Callum's flat ie Callum himself, or those who had cuckooed him, appeared not to have been explored or determined during his life. At inquest, it was felt more likely to have been done by those without permission to be in the flat. This led to the question of what was an appropriate response to the discovery of the damage. It was recognised that a tenant who caused substantial damage to his flat may reasonably expect to be evicted by his landlord. Equally, it was felt that a vulnerable tenant ruthlessly exploited by thugs who took over his flat deserved support and assistance and not punishment. It was felt this had not been worked through by Sanctuary Housing before it made the decision to serve a Notice Seeking Possession on Callum who took his own life only weeks after its receipt. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Going forward, the issue for Sanctuary Housing is how it should respond to concerns of cuckooing of its tenants.</span> Please see paragraphs 150-160 of the enclosed judgment for further detail. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24 July 2025.

This report is being sent to: Home Office
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 30 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of William James Armstrong aged 24.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 June 2023. The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a. [REDACTED] Toxicity I returned a narrative conclusion that William James Armstrong died as the consequence of the effects of a significant quantity of [REDACTED] deliberately self-administered in circumstances where his intentions remain unclear by reason of a combination of recently consumed alcohol and a prodromal insidious onset of an undiagnosed psychotic illness. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction. Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + mental health">This report is being published following updates from Greater Manchester Police and suicide prevention organisations received on the 14th of March 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a history that had included episodic low mood, with fleeting examples of previous suicidal ideation, but no formal mental health diagnosis had been made.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + local + mental health">He had been treated conservatively and discharged by local community-based mental health services following the deceased's non-engagement.</span> In October 2022, a consultant psychiatrist assessed the deceased to be in a phase of gradual decline with fluctuating symptoms that included hallucinations with distorted thinking and perception suggestive of a prodromal insidious onset of a psychotic illness with decline in social functioning. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + mental health">The views of the psychiatrist were communicated to the deceased's general practitioner, who having discussed matters with the deceased and his family, persevered with a conservative, reactive pathway of primary care and did not refer the deceased to further community mental health intervention as suggested by the psychiatrist, but whether this decision had any bearing upon the outcome remains unclear.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">At 10.58pm on the 22nd of May 2021, North West Ambulance Service received an emergency call from the deceased, informing them that he had consumed an quantity of [REDACTED] with ‘metformin blue' 15 minutes earlier, that he was now not breathing normally and in effect, he was seeking to be rescued.</span> The call was categorised as a ‘Category 2' response using the prevailing Medical Priority Dispatch System. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: conditions + ambulance">By reason of operational conditions that evening, there was an 89-minute delay in response with an ambulance arriving on scene at 11.27pm.</span> The deceased was found collapsed, unresponsive in room 49 of the hotel. He failed to respond to resuscitation and was confirmed as dead at 11.37pm. Police investigations established that the deceased had booked into the hotel at about 9pm that night and had earlier acquired the [REDACTED] using the internet from a source in Russia. No note or other evidence of intention was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: guidance + guidance + training + training">The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces' in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off' basis for the means of self-harming. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: presumed">Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report "suspicious" transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. d.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">The current Home Office guidance and supporting video, leaflet and posters do not reference [REDACTED] as a specific example of concern and focuses on the phenomenon of ‘malicious' misuse and not deliberate misuse in the sense of suicide/self-harm. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - COVID ✓ + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: covid + national">The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown' living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Vendors were unaware that their website/details were being distributed as part of internet information platforms designed to aid, abet, assist or promote suicide methods. d.</span> From the specific example of 247 supplies in a 12-month period, police established that 45 purchasers were confirmed as deceased (these deaths were in relation to supplies to UK customers and purchasers from abroad) and only 15 purchases were confirmed to have taken place for legitimate purposes (meat curing etc.). 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 08 March 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kelly Michelle Walsh aged 45.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 07 February 2023. The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a [REDACTED] toxicity I returned a short form conclusion that Kelly Michelle Walsh died as the result of suicide. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction. Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024. This report is being published following updates from Greater Manchester Police and suicide prevention organisations received on the 14th of March 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On the 27th of February 2021 the deceased was discovered in a collapsed and unresponsive condition within her residence, where attending paramedics confirmed her as dead and beyond attempted resuscitation. Attending police confirmed an absence of suspicious circumstances and recovered no note or other direct expression of her intent. The deceased's post-mortem samples revealed the presence of recently ingested and fatally toxic levels of [REDACTED] from which metabolised quantities of [REDACTED] was also noted to be present. The deceased had recently sourced and acquired a quantity of [REDACTED] from an internet-based supplier in Lithuania. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: guidance + guidance + training + training">The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces' in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off' basis for the means of self-harming. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: presumed">Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report "suspicious" transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. d.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">The current Home Office guidance and supporting video, leaflet and posters do not reference [REDACTED] as a specific example of concern and focuses on the phenomenon of ‘malicious' misuse and not deliberate misuse in the sense of suicide/self-harm. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - COVID ✓ + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: covid + national">The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown' living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Vendors were unaware that their website/details were being distributed as part of internet information platforms designed to aid, abet, assist or promote suicide methods. d.</span> From the specific example of 247 supplies in a 12-month period, police established that 45 purchasers were confirmed as deceased (these deaths were in relation to supplies to UK customers and purchasers from abroad) and only 15 purchases were confirmed to have taken place for legitimate purposes (meat curing etc.). 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps

How, in what way and with other necessary preparations (in particular -antiemetic medications) the poisons should be administered. c. Sourcing such poisons/chemicals/medications in the UK and abroad. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 16, 2025.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST An Investigation into the death commenced on the 8th of January 2021 and an Inquest heard before me on the 2nd of December 2022 that concluded the Investigation.</span> The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a [REDACTED] toxicity I returned a narrative conclusion that Chantelle Williams died as the consequence an unknown quantity of recently self-administered [REDACTED] in circumstances where her intentions remain unclear. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction. Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024. <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

Keywords: staff + staff + presumed">Healthcare staff were aware of the deceased's ongoing possession of [REDACTED] and the high risk of self-harm with significant risk of deliberate or inadvertent overdose and her presumed or known possession of [REDACTED] was managed conservatively by reason of the deceased's status as a voluntary inpatient who had been continually assessed to have capacity.</span> On the 29th of May 2020 at approximately 6.45am the deceased was observed in her room on Keats Ward in a collapsed, unresponsive and cyanosed condition. She was being observed hourly and had last been seen alive at about 6am. An immediate ‘crash call' was made but she failed to respond to attempted resuscitation and was verified as dead at 7.20am that morning. Post-mortem samples from the deceased revealed the presence of fatally toxic levels of both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], likely from a single batch of [REDACTED] the deceased had previously sourced, retained and hidden. The evidence does not establish the precise quantity or time she ingested the [REDACTED] but was analysed to be at levels that would rapidly, within minutes, precipitate unconsciousness, hypoxia and cardio-respiratory failure. The deceased had, incidentally, been properly prescribed promethazine - a sedating antihistamine to assist her sleep, that would also have produced an antiemetic effect. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Police recovered no note or evidence of her intentions and were able to establish no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: guidance + guidance + training">The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces' in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off' basis for the means of self-harming. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: presumed">Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report "suspicious" transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. d.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: national">The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown' living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

How, in what way and with other necessary preparations (in particular -antiemetic medications) the poisons should be administered. c.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shaun Michael Bass aged 23.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 August 2022. The medical cause of death was determined to be; 1a. [REDACTED] toxicity. I returned a short form conclusion that Shaun Michael Bass died as the result of suicide. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction. Reporting restrictions were lifted on the 19th of April 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: treatment + care + care + medical history">This report is being published following updates from Greater Manchester Police and suicide prevention organisations received on the 14th of March 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a medical history that included persistent and enduring anxiety and depressive disorders that had required previous inpatient phases of treatment and care but had recently been treated and managed conservatively in the community.</span> On the 23rd of February 2020, the deceased was discovered collapsed and unresponsive in his residence at [REDACTED], Bolton having ingested a significant quantity of [REDACTED] that he had acquired earlier in the month from an internet-based company licensed to sell reportable poisons. He was verified as dead and beyond further attempted resuscitation by attending paramedics. From within the premises, police recovered a note of intent recently handwritten by the deceased and empty packaging labelled "[REDACTED] - Extra Pure 99.9% 50g" - for meat curing" the deceased had sourced via accessing a website promoting and sanctioning self-harm by means of [REDACTED] poisoning. Post-mortem samples were analysed and confirmed the deceased had recently ingested a significant and fatally toxic quantity of [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + concerns + care + care + review + assessment">The evidence established suboptimal elements in the mental healthcare and management of the deceased namely, a lack of continuity of personnel responsible for the deceased's care co-ordination, no mental health assessment review that was due to have taken place in November 2019, no adequate or immediate response to family concerns that had been communicated to health care professionals in January and February 2020.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: mental health + concerns + review + risk + record">Whilst the consequence of the suboptimal healthcare in terms of bearing upon outcome cannot be evaluated, they represent a series of missed opportunities to record, discuss, review or adequately safeguard the deceased during a phase of deterioration in his mental health with the consequence that treating healthcare professionals failed to appreciate that the deceased was at an increased risk of self-harm. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: guidance + guidance + training">The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces' in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off' basis for the means of self-harming. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: presumed">Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report "suspicious" transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. d.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: national">The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown' living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: medication + mental health + team + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Mrs Beasley was seen at home following a call to the mental health crisis team and required a full V4 mental health assessment that did not take place and instead an SBAR review was completed, and the nurse did not scrutinise the medications and medication changes that had been previously made and made errors about the doses.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: mental health + informed + information">Mrs Beasley was informed she was discharged back to her GP, but no actions were sent by the mental health Trust to the GP. (2) Following this Mrs Beasley contacted crisis mental health explaining that she had vital information that she had not shared following a visit by a psychiatric nurse at her home.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

Keywords: information + team + team">Mrs Beasley contacted the crisis team again a few days later repeating that she had not shared information and again was not asked what the information was and was not given an appointment.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: information + record">Mrs Beasley's telephone contacts were noted in her medical record with no details recorded as to what the additional information Mrs Beasley wanted to share.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: medication + mental health + team + team">Mrs Beasley did not receive the appropriate psychiatric assessment following her contact with the crisis team. (3) Mrs Beasley was conveyed to hospital having taken an overdose of medication and was reviewed by the Trust mental health liaison team.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Review of the mental health Trust medical records would have shown that Mrs Beasley had an SBAR review rather than a V4 mental health assessment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + mental health + staff + staff">This should have alerted staff to the fact that an urgent assessment was required when Mrs Beasley attended mental health liaison following an overdose of her medication.</span> This did not happen. (4) Mrs Beasley had been requesting an urgent appoint and responded immediately to a letter from the Trust informing her she needed an urgent psychiatric appointment. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: medication + mental health + communicating + information + between + between + team + team">The crisis team were not communicating effectively either with Mrs Beasley, her GP or internally within their own team. (5) Multiple experienced members of the mental health teams had contact with Mrs Beasley between January and March and did not make detailed entries into the medical or ask questions of Mrs Beasley about what additional information she had to provide about her risks of harm and suicidal ideation, review of her medication given her deteriorating mental health and calls to the crisis team disclosing increasing suicidal thoughts and ideation accompanied by acts and plans.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

[REDACTED], CEO, North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT), CEME Centre, March Way, Rainham, Essex, RM13 8GQ Sent via email: [REDACTED] Cc: [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Nadia Persaud, Area Coroner for the coroner area of East London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 27 November 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of George Kenneth Fraser, aged 37 years old.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 May 2025.

Mr. Fraser's sister attended his home address and found him clearly deceased within the premises. A paramedic attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. A post-mortem examination was carried out. Despite a post-mortem examination, which included specialist tests for toxicology and neuropathology, a cause of death could not be identified. The pathologist considered that Mr. Fraser had likely passed away a few weeks before he was found. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Safety Culture + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Four calls were made to the police that day to request that they attend the Deceased's home address to check on her welfare. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

The second call was made by the Deceased's mother at 16:38. The call was made on the 999 number. The call handler asked the Deceased's mother if the Deceased had made a threat of suicide today and when the Deceased's mother said that she hadn't, the call handler advised the Deceased's mother to call back on 101. It was acknowledged at the inquest that it was not best practice to have asked the caller to call back on 101. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

A chewed up teddy bear could be seen on the living room floor and the Deceased would not normally leave a chewed up teddy bear on the floor for fear that it would choke the dog. 7.

Keywords: mental health + concerns + care, sensitive + time + risk + team + mental health + attendance + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) During the 16:44 call, by following the "Right Care, Right Person" procedure there was a refusal to the request that the police attend, even when a family member was expressing the view that there was a real and immediate risk to life. (2) During the 16:44 call the "Right Care, Right Person" advice to contact mental health services appears to have disregarded the fact that the mental health crisis team do not have the power to enter locked premises and so would require police attendance to facilitate entry to the premises. (3) During the 16:57 call there was no decision for police to attend, even though this was the third caller (and second professional caller) that had expressed serious concerns about the Deceased. (4) Although there is a procedure in place to have a negative "Right Care, Right Person" decision reviewed by a supervisor, this causes additional delay in circumstances when attendance could be extremely time-sensitive. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisations have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 July 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: [REDACTED] (Mother of the Deceased) [REDACTED] (Legal representative of Durham Constabulary) I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

(2) During the 16:44 call the "Right Care, Right Person" advice to contact mental health services appears to have disregarded the fact that the mental health crisis team do not have the power to enter locked premises and so would require police attendance to facilitate entry to the premises. (3) During the 16:57 call there was no decision for police to attend, even though this was the third caller (and second professional caller) that had expressed serious concerns about the Deceased. (4) Although there is a procedure in place to have a negative "Right Care, Right Person" decision reviewed by a supervisor, this causes additional delay in circumstances when attendance could be extremely time-sensitive. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisations have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 July 2025.</td>

This report is being sent to: West Yorkshire Police
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] , Chief Constable West Yorkshire Police 1 CORONER I am Peter MERCHANT, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Yorkshire Western Coroner Area 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15 February 2024 the death of Paul Andrew Alexander was reported to this jurisdiction.</span> A forensic autopsy was conducted on 17 February 2024, and an investigation into the death was commenced. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: between">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest between 13 and 15 May 2025.</span> The medical cause of death was 1a cold water immersion. A narrative conclusion of the inquest was that: Paul Andrew Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness since December 1989. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

This represented a missed opportunity. However, it is not possible to determine whether Paul's death would have been avoided given the likelihood is that his death occurred shortly after entering the water at Aspley Marina at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH As identified above, Paul Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: care + information + care + ambulance">Under the Right Care Right persons framework (RCRP) the call was redirected to the ambulance service who did not attend as the caller was unable to provide them with a location (contrary to information provided to the police in the initial call).</span> The call was redirected back to the police. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: between">The caller became frustrated with being passed between the emergency services and terminated the call.</span> No attempt was made to contact the caller again. As such no emergency services were dispatched. Subsequently, on 6 and 7 February 2024, following further calls to the police Paul was identified as a missing person, initially as a medium risk and then a high risk. On 14 February 2024, a body was discovered in the water at Aspley Marina, Huddersfield. This was subsequently identified as Paul. In the ensuing police investigation CCTV last identified Paul as being alive at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024 when he was seen running across a car park and down a flight of stairs towards the marina. He was not being chased and was observed on the CCTV to be behaving bizarrely. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: concerns + time">The conclusion was that he entered the water in the marina at that time and died as a consequence of cold-water immersion. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the course of the evidence, it became apparent the police had introduced RCRP in September 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: national">RCRP is a police initiative arising out of a national agreement but to be implemented by individual police forces.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: situation">Little or no consultation with other agencies had taken place prior to the implementation of RCRP in September 2023.Whilst I heard evidence that meetings with other agencies now do take place, the specifics of Paul's case and the broader issues it raises have not been discussed nor is there any understanding/ agreement in place as to how such a situation would now be addressed.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: situation + between + ambulance">As much as the court was advised was that if a similar situation arose today, there may be a discussion between operational managers in the respective police and ambulance call centres, but that this would be reliant upon the matter being brought to the attention of those respective managers by the call taker.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">The evidence from the RCRP lead at the ambulance service indicated the scenario that arose with Paul was not an isolated example.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)

The treating clinicians felt the acute setting was detrimental to her health and the prolonged stay contributed to a decline in her health. She began to rapidly decline and had a series of infections that caused her to become increasingly frail. She died on 28th October 2024 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary from bilateral pneumonia. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. The inquest heard evidence that the prolonged hospital stay and lack of progress in finding a suitable place in the community significantly contributed to her decline. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

This report is being sent to: Essex County Council
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Director, Adult Social Care Mid Alliance Safeguarding, MCA and DoLs, Essex County Council, County Hall, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 1QH 1 CORONER I am Sean Horstead, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Essex 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 24 th November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Linda Marilyn Sitch, aged 75 years.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of a three-day inquest on the 3 rd April 2025. Mrs Sitch died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a [REDACTED] overdose . <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: mental health + physical + elderly">My Narrative Conclusion confirmed that Mrs Sitch (hereafter ‘Linda') had taken her own life on a background of the impact upon her emotional and mental health well-being of looking after her elderly husband (with whom she had shared a long and happy marriage) and who, himself, suffered from significant on-going mental and physical health problems.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - a. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor
Keywords: concerns + assessment + referral">Although not determined to be probably causative of the death, by the date of Linda's death ASC had failed to respond substantively or at all to the Adult Safeguarding Referral dated 29 th September 2023; the referral for a Carer's Assessment for Linda herself, received by ASC on 2 nd October 2023; the concerns reiterated by Linda's family when chasing the 2 nd October referral on 16 th October 2023.</span> These failures were explained as ‘human error'. b. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Supervision and Leadership + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: mental health + assessment + manager + referral + team">The oral evidence of the ASC Service Manager at the inquest (though not mentioned in her statement prepared for the purposes of the inquest), confirmed that the Team Manager responsible for downgrading the Priority 1 status of the carer's assessment referral on 2 nd October to Priority 2, without recording a rationale, had likely done so without undertaking the required consideration of either the readily available ASG referral of the 29 th September, or the Mental Health Act assessment of Linda herself from the previous year.</span> She agreed that, had an estimated "ten minute" review of the "slim files" for both Linda and her husband been undertaken, as should have happened, the Priority level could not and would not have been reasonably downgraded . <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Supervision and Leadership

Keywords: risk + referral">Absent a sufficiently robust system for providing oversight and identifying and significantly mitigating (if not entirely removing) such individual human error, alongside, for example, the inclusion of simple auditable check lists of matters to be accessed, reviewed and documented whenever a referral is received, then there is a continuing risk of urgent future referrals being inappropriately graded as Priority 2 (and/or being downgraded from Priority 1) without the requisite thorough and professional review, adequately documented, being undertaken.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

The conclusion of the jury inquest was a short form conclusion of Suicide in box 4. The Jury's answer to ‘when, where and how' was recorded in box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows: "Anne was a 54 year old menopausal woman experiencing a number of stresses in her life. The menopause contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety. On the 27 th September 2002, Anne took an overdose of paracetamol. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

After found wandering in traffic and absconding from her home, on the 20 th October 2022, she agreed to a voluntary admission to Rowan Ward. She was then detained on a section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. On the 21 st October 2022 this was upgraded to a section 2 detention. On the 24 th October 2022, she was granted her first Section 17 Leave. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

During her review on the 29 th November 2022, Anne was authorised for Section 17 Leave for an overnight stay at home on the 4 th December 2022. On the 3 rd December 2022 she had a day with her family in Bristol. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: information">Anne's family did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay.</span> She went home on the 4 th December 2022 and in the morning of the Fifth December 2022 Anne used a key to open the back door, took a car key and drove away. Anne was driving on the Eastbound carriageway of the A303 and at 07:48 she deliberately drove into the path of a HGV tank lorry on the opposite carriageway." The medical cause of death was recorded as: Ia) Multiple traumatic injuries 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Anne first presented to her GP in 2008. During this year she had three separate appointments relating to underlying anxiety and being unable to cope. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">There was no secondary mental health service involvement, nor was there any prescription of anti- depressants at this time.</span> Anne presented to the GP again in 2014, so six years later. Her presentation at this time was felt by the GP to be a grief/bereavement reaction. From early 2017 up to the end of 2019 there were five separate consultations for gynaecological and/or gastroenterological presentations but despite secondary investigations, no underlying physiological cause was found and the GP felt that there was a high possibility that her tummy and bowel issues were related to her underlying anxiety. On the 18 th December 2020, Anne had her first significant consultation about mental health symptoms. She was extremely anxious and low in mood and stressed with life in general. On the 11 th January 2021 Anne was emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed. This was the first consultation at which menopause (or perimenopause) was mentioned. Given her presentation it would appear that her underling anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017. Anne started taking Sertraline in February 2021 (she was prescribed this in the January but was too anxious about side effects to start taking it). She was also started on HRT. By the end of May 2021 her symptoms appeared to be under control but it was impossibly to know if this was the Sertraline, the HRT or a combination of both. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">In July of 2021, following consultation with her GP, the dose of Sertraline was titrated down so that by the Autumn of 2021 she had stopped taking this medication altogether.</span> In early September 2022, Anne's presentation declined again and she agreed to re- start Sertraline. On the 27 th September 2022 Anne was at home with her husband when she informed him she'd taken [REDACTED] tablets. This was the first time Anne had done anything like this before and it was very much the start of her acute decline. After discharge from hospital she was seen daily by the mental health team, and declined an admission. On the 20 th October 2022, Anne did agree to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit. This was after she had been returned home by the police who responded to a member of the public who had called in after finding her wandering in traffic. Anne was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. She remained detained up till the date of her death; being placed on a Section 2 detention and this was upgraded to a Section 3 detention on the 16 th November 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

She remained on the ward without leave for three days after this incident. On the 29 th November 2022 an MDT (Multi Disciplinary Meeting) took place. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Anne went out for 6 hours on the 3 rd December 2022 to a Christmas market in Bristol with her husband. This leave went well and without incident. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Anne's husband had locked the doors and windows and hidden those keys in a desk drawer. He did not hide the car keys as he did not think for one minute that his wife would take the car. That morning Anne found the back door key in the desk drawer and took the car. She was seen driving erratically by multiple other road users who were travelling eastbound on the A303 that morning. At around 07:48 Anne drove her car into the path of a fully laden HGV tanker travelling on the westbound carriageway. There was nothing the tanker driver could have done to avoid the collision.

Keywords: care + care">Whilst it was widely accepted in this case that Anne's husband was well versed and knowledgeable about his wife's risks and the measures that might be necessary to help keep her safe whilst she was at home, not all families are as involved in their loved one's psychiatric care, despite the Trust following the Triangle of Care principles.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: access + risk + patient">This concern (and any action deemed appropriate by the recipients of this PFD) is not intended to override autonomy of the patient and their own ability/responsibility to keep themselves safe, but the concern centres around their being an opportunity to assist families in spotting early warning signs that ‘something is wrong' and to seek help and intervention (if/when appropriate) to minimise the risk of a patient taking their own life whilst in the community. (2) It transpired during the Inquest that if an in-patient (detained or voluntary) accesses the secure unit Wi-Fi there are no algorithms or ‘search detection features' to prevent access to websites pertaining to self harm and so these can be readily accessed by a group who are already vulnerable due to their acute mental health presentation with some element of inherent risk of suicide.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: access + care + care + facilities">Part 2 (3) I am (and remain, having previously issued a PFD in a similar vain on the 26 th June 2024) concerned about the lack of ‘importance' given to menopausal care available to women on the NHS; especially when compared to private sector meaning that women who are not fortunate enough to be able to access private clinics and facilities may not be able to access the services and expertise they need at a very crucial transitional phase in their lives.</span> Menopause is not a lifestyle choice, it is an unavoidable part of a woman's natural biological cycle. Without wishing to introduce sweeping generalisations, menopause is likely to affect 50% of the population at some point in their lives [according to Statistics Times, women made up 50.75% of the UK population in 2024]. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Keywords: access + care + care">Not all GP surgeries have a menopause specialist practitioner (or access to one) despite a GP usually being the first port of call for women in the community when seeking primary care.</span> Those GP Surgeries who do have a practitioner who acts as a ‘specialist' is often a GP with a personal interest who has taken the initiative to go on courses and broaden their learning and understanding, rather than any mandatory requirement for a Surgery [or group with multiple surgeries] to have an available community ‘front-line' specialist. I was told that the Trust does not have an "expert" in this field and it would be difficult to have one as menopause isn't a disease or an illness. Whilst I do not dispute that is it not a disease, menopause is a condition ; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care">I was told during a previous PFD Response relating to menopausal knowledge and care within the NHS that "It is important to ensure that women understand common symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression which they might experience during the menopause and where and when to seek help.</span> The NHS website has resources ...." This emphasises my concerns entirely; the lack of importance given to menopausal symptoms. If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase] ‘have a look at a website to help'. I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently, their individual experience is unique to them and this, to some degree, creates difficulties as a ‘one size fits all' approach (which is perhaps achievable in other medical specialisms and disciplines) cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care">I had previously been told (back in a 2024 PFD response) of a roll-out of specialist menopausal care and upskilling of GPs but there was little evidence during the inquest that this has happened/is happening and women continue to approach and navigate the menopause without the support of expert clinicians or practitioners who understand and can treat the symptoms they are experiencing. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 th June 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

This report is being sent to: REDACTED
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Patient Safety, Women's Health and Mental Health) 1 CORONER I am Crispin OLIVER, Senior Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of County Durham and Darlington 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26/05/2023 14:31an investigation was commenced into the death of Loraine Michelle CHEESMAN 12/06/1968 00:00:00.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 03/04/2025 10:18. The conclusion of the inquest was that Died at [REDACTED], Darlington, on 13 May 2023 as a consequence of a fire at the property. The Hoarding Disorder and Executive Dysfunction from which she suffered made a more than minimal contribution to the fire.. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Died at [REDACTED], Darlington, on 13 May 2023 as a consequence of a fire at the property. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The Hoarding Disorder and Executive Dysfunction from which she suffered made a more than minimal contribution to the fire. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: care + guidance + care + care + guidance">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Department of Health and Social Care (2023), Care and Support Statutory Guidance, Section 14.17 states in relation to Self Neglect and Hoarding Disorder: "This covers a wide range of behaviour neglecting to care of one's personal hygiene, health or surroundings and includes behaviour such as hoarding.</span> It should be noted that self- neglect may not prompt a section 42 enquiry. An assessment should be made on a case by case basis. A decision on whether a response is required under safeguarding will depend on the adult's ability to protect themselves by controlling their own behaviour. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">There may come a point when they are no longer able to do this, without external support." During the course of the evidence I heard from social workers and safeguarding professionals than in relation to assessing whether "the point" had been reached in relation to an adult suffering from Hoarding Disorder and Executive Dysfunction there was no specific guidance and that such guidance would in future be welcome.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">Currently they are constrained by existing guidance for assessing mental capacity, which does not directly recognise Executive Dysfunction, or for assessing whether the adult's behaviour constitutes a potentially chargeable criminal or regulatory offence, for example in relation to public nuisance, health hazard, or anti social behaviour, rather than the root cause of the behaviour - a mental disorder or disorders.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">So, the matter of concern consists of this request - for guidance to be provided as to how to incorporate consideration of Executive Dysfunction into the assessment of mental capacity and how to assess when the point when external intervention can be triggered has been reached. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 29, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Sian Reeves, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of South London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 March 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Christopher McDonald, who was aged 41 at the time of his death.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

The medical cause of death was: 1a Ligature strangulation; and 2 Schizoaffective disorder. The conclusion of the jury as to the death was that Mr McDonald died by strangulation by a ligature that he applied around his neck, but the evidence did not enable them to say what his intentions were. The following matters were recorded in the narrative conclusion: (1) There were shortcomings in the decision-making in relation to the suspension of Mr McDonald's section 17 leave on 24 February 2023, which possibly contributed to his death. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures

Keywords: clear + assessment + staff + staff, patient + patient + policy">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that staff working on the NPU did not have knowledge or a clear understanding of the "AWOL - Missing & Absent Persons Policy" of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust ("SLAM") Specifically: (1) Whilst there should be an individualised assessment of whether it is appropriate to suspend section 17 when a patient goes AWOL: (a) one member of staff at the inquest gave evidence that it was "standard practice" and "protocol" that leave would be suspended; and (b) there was no evidence of any individualised assessment in Mr McDonald's case. (2) The policy provides that SLAM staff should always accompany the police if the patient is to be returned from their home.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: needs + between, staff + between, staff, patient + patient + policy">This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that any member of NPU staff considered this once Mr McDonald was located at his mother's address on 24 February 2023. (3) The policy provides that if the police are likely to be involved in returning the patient to hospital then an action plan - jointly drafted between the police and Trust staff - needs to be drawn up.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I have also sent it to NHS England and the Metropolitan Police who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Keywords: mental health + between + between + team">It was accepted in evidence a more assertive approach to attempt to engage Claire, and in complex cases generally, could have been used and there could have been better liaison between the police and the enhanced community mental health team when Claire was in custody.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors

(2) The inquest heard that training on the effect of substance misuse on mental health conditions is not mandatory for all staff and would be of assistance when caring for patients such as Claire. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 May 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis. (via email to his legal representative) [REDACTED], Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing (via [REDACTED]) 1 CORONER I am Professor Fiona J Wilcox, HM Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Inner West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST From 3 rd March to 24 th March 2025, evidence was heard before a jury touching the death of Mr Oladeji Adeyemi Omishore. He had died on the 4 th June 2022, aged 41 years, in ITU at St Thomas's Hospital. He had died following an incident involving police officers on Chelsea Bridge during which he was tasered a number of times and then jumped into the River Thames. Medical Cause of Death 1 a. Complications arising from drowning How, when, where and in what circumstances the deceased came by his death; and conclusions as recorded by the jury [in this case by combining boxes 3 and 4 of the Record of Inquest] : On 4 th June 2022, Mr Omishore was suffering with a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis. In October 2019 he had suffered his first episode of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis based on medical evidence we have heard and accepted. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: care + team + team">He continued to receive care and deemed stable by the health care team in March 2022.</span> Recent cannabis use likely caused or contributed to this relapse of his illness. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: unwell">We have considered and noted his previous behaviour when psychiatrically unwell.</span> Mr Omishore left his home on the morning of 4 th June 2022 shouting in the middle of the road and waving what is now known to be a firelighter. This prompted a number of 999 calls from members of the public. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: aggressive behaviour, unwell">Amongst other things, the public raised shouting religious remarks, a perceived weapon, aggressive behaviour and that he seemed mentally unwell.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">The call handlers determined critical information and passed to dispatchers which included location, weapon and description, with all calls being graded I grade (immediate response).</span> Responding police officers were told by dispatchers the location, suspicious circumstances, weapons and a brief description via the airwaves. Mental health (MH) was not passed over the airwaves. We note from witnesses this should and could have been passed over the airwaves. The call was accepted by the responding officers at 09:03:54. It was accepted 20 seconds after it was put over the airwaves. The response officers understood they were responding to an I grade call on Chelsea Bridge Road, which they were aware had at least 3 I grades. When the response officers arrived, Mr Omishore was in the middle of the road on the North side of Chelsea Bridge when the officers first saw him. The officers perceived him to be holding a screwdriver. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Keywords: risk assessment, risk, assessment">The response officers gave evidence that they believed this was a genuine threat and took a risk assessment in line with NDM.</span> The response officers arrived at 09:05:43 and the taser officer got out the car with taser drawn and shouted commands to identify himself as a police officer and to draw attention to the taser. Following lack of compliance to drop the object, the taser officer fired the first taser at 09:06:15, in response to non-compliance and movement in the direction of the ono-taser officer. Mr Omishore dropped to the ground and dropped the object. Following the first taser, Mr Omishore was rolling around on the ground and was not under control. The non-taser officer kicked the object away from reach. Mr Omishore attempted to get up and swiped towards the non taser officer and there was a second discharge. The second taser did not allow control of Mr Omishore. <span style="background-color:#D6D8D9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: barrier">Following the third taser discharge, Mr Omishore got up and jumped over the pedestrian barrier.</span> The non- taser officer followed. Mr Omishore swung his hand towards the non-taser officer and knocked the handcuffs out of his hand. The taser officer deployed the second and final cartridge to stop Mr Omishore. Mr Omishore jumped off Chelsea Bridge and into the River Thames at 09:06:53-55. He was rescued at 09:18 and was given CPR and taken to St Thomas's Hospital. He was recognised as life extinct on ITU at St Thomas's Hospital at 20:29 on 4 th June 2022. Matters that we find possibly caused or contributed to the death. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: training">Despite the response officers having all required training, the use of the taser did not achieve full NMI.</span> Had the officers been able to achieve full NMI, there is a possibility they could have gained control of Mr Omishore and therefore the inability to achieve full NMI and gain control of Mr Omishore possibly contributed to his death. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Information from members of the public (that in their opinion Mr Omishore was suffering from a mental health crisis) was not passed to responding officers before they arrived at the scene.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">We have heard evidence that such information should and could have been passed on.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">We have also heard evidence from the responding officers that such information would not have changed their approach.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The majority of the jury find that, had mental health concerns been passed over the airwaves, it is possible this may have had an impact on the sequence of events that may have contributed to Mr Omishore's death.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: unwell">Probable Causes Mr Omishore had suffered a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis and was severely unwell.</span> This illness affected his understanding and was the likely cause of his actions on Chelsea Bridge Road and Chelsea Bridge prior to and after the arrival of thepolice. It is likely that he was frightened by what he was seeing and what he thought he was seeing and lacked insight. Whilst the body worn and phone footage show him running away from police after he had been tasered for the third time, it cannot be concluded that the actions of the police probably caused his death. 4 Evidence relevant to the matters of concern. Extensive evidence was taken and exhibited and some potential regulation 28 matters explored. Please see the detailed findings of the jury laid out above. Of relevance to this report: 1. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: unwell">Mr Omishore had been observed by multiple members of the public on Chelsea Bridge Road and then on Chelsea Bridge, in the minutes leading up to the incident behaving in a manner that suggested he was mentally unwell.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: concerns + unwell">There were 7 calls by members of the public to the Metropolitan Police to report concerns and in 3 out of 7 of these calls the member of the public told the call handlers/first responders that Mr Omishore appeared mentally unwell.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">This was only recorded by one call handler on the CHS system and passed to the CAD and thus dispatchers in "remarks." This information was never transmitted over the airwaves to the responding officers and so could not have been considered in their NDMs prior to their arrival at the scene.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">The responding officers had no access to CADs to undertake their own assessment prior to arriving at the incident due to a combination of lack of time to start their computer tablet and to load and search CADs due to the immediacy of their arrival and the IVMA was not working.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">They were thus reliant on the information passed to them over the radio.</span> Only one radio channel was used in this incident. 2. Extensive evidence was taken in relation to this matter. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">In summary: call handlers stated that given the main threat was that Mr Omishore had been reported as carrying a weapon, either knife or screwdriver, they regarded mental health as a secondary matter and did not put the information in the "golden line", and indeed two did not record it all.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Neither was the information recorded in the NICL codes.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: care + information + factors + risk">The main reasons given for this was that in their views, the NICL codes should list the main risk factors, only three are available and if a mental health NICL code was recorded then it would need a further code qualifying it as "believed" as the information was unconfirmed as reported by a member of the public rather than a health care professional, or relative with first-hand knowledge of the subject.</span> There was also mention of the officers' duties to consider such matters once they have arrived at the scene of an incident. 3. Several witnesses stated that a code "mental health believed" would be of assistance as then there would likely have been enough NICL codes available for it to be used. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">There was some inconsistency therefore between whether it should be recorded at all, and if so where it should have been recorded. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">To be clear it was accepted in the evidence that mental health should have been recorded and passed out over the airwaves to responding officers as it would have assisted those officers in their NDM considerations. 5.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">The evidence from dispatchers based at AWS, was that the information in relation to possible mental health matters should have been recorded and passed to them to put out.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: clear + information">It was clear from the evidence that the information that was passed to dispatchers was not put out in error- it was simply missed. 6.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">These dispatchers described how they relied on information in the "golden line" and NICL codes to get information out onto the radio asap, and so it could be inferred that had information in relation to mental health issues been recorded either in the "golden line" or NICL codes it would have been likely to have been transmitted by them. 7.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling
Keywords: analysis">Analysis of various CADs as part of the evidence also showed that several units (up to 6, it was difficult to understand) had been allocated to respond to this incident in addition to three units heard to respond over the airwave radio.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">None of this potentially important information was passed over the airwaves, and again therefore could not have been considered by responding officers and thus feed into their NDMs. 8.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">The incident was being monitored in dispatch AWS by a controller performing multiple tasks who had also missed the remarks in relation to mental health and not passed on information over the airwaves in relation to units assigned by CAD from another geographic dispatch pod (AWC) over the airwave radio. 9.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: needs + staff + staff + training">Evidence was also taken in relation to the increased use of taser in black men and those persons with mental health needs and the training given to staff and officers in relation to these matters. 10.</span> Evidence was taken in relation to THRIVE. 11. In relation to the response of the officers, the taser armed officer deployed with his taser drawn and pointed at Mr Omishore and did not consider mental health as a possible cause for Mr Omishore's actions until after the first use of the taser. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">However, had he been provided with information that Mr Omishore appeared to be suffered with mental ill health prior to his arrival at the scene, this could have fed into his NDM and may have affected the manner of his deployment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: clear + risk + language + training">This may have reduced the risk of escalation arsing not only from sight of the taser but also the training requirement to use clear and commanding language to a subject once a taser has been deployed.</span> <span style="background-color:#D6D8D9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: language">Such language is different in tone and style to that taught to officers to use when attempting to de- escalate a situation where the subject is suffering mental distress.</span> These matters could not be found to have likely affected the outcome in this case. 5 Matters of Concern 1. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Keywords: information + training">That the call handlers/ first responders may have a training issue in relation to the importance of recording this information in manner which is likely to be passed on to responding officers by dispatchers, for example in the NICL codes and/ or "golden line". 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: information + training">That the above concern of potential training need is highlighted by the increased use of taser in black men and those suffering mental health issues and so the real need for this information to be recorded and passed on in the most effective form.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: information + training">Whilst training for first responders appears to include advice as how to communicate with persons suffering with mental health issues, it does not appear to contain any advice in relation to the importance of such information to be recorded especially in relation to black men. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: risk + factor">That the limitation of 3 NICL codes makes it difficult to record mental health as a qualifier in incidents such as this where the main risk factor is the weapon. 5.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: information + training">That call handlers/first responders may need training as to where to record such information i.e. in the "golden line" or NCIL code, as long as of course it is reported to them before the "golden line" and NICL code has gone out. 6.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">That use of THRIVE usually requires time that is not available in I grade calls and does not mitigate the need to circulate promptly information as to mental health issues, in the format most likely to digested and passed on by dispatchers that is "golden line" or NICL codes. 7.</span> That the lack of NICL code "mental health believed" compounds this. 8. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) 1 CORONER I am Kate Robertson, Assistant Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 July 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Leanne Marie Carroll (DOB 6/9/1996) who died on 29 June 2024.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 March 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + time + mental health">The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion that ‘Death was due to misadventure where Leanne had not been referred to the Perinatal Mental Health Service either during her pregnancy or at any point up to her death'. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Leanne Marie Carroll was aged 27 at the time of her death on 29 June 2024.</span> She had given birth to her first child approximately 8 months prior to her death. Leanne suffered from anxiety and, although not diagnosed, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: mental health + mental health + team">She sought assistance from her GP and she was referred in March 2024 to the Community Mental Health Team.</span> She was referred to an OCD support group. It was noted that her OCD had deteriorated since giving birth. Leanne died from the excessive consumption of prescribed and non-prescribed medications. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Management of Staff and Staffing Levels

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

Keywords: access + decisions">The Single Point of Access meetings which occur on a daily basis by way of triaging referrals do not provide written records of the discussions had and decisions made.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Keywords: access + decisions + awareness">I am concerned that deaths will occur into the future as awareness of the Service is not at all adequate to health professionals, the Service is not adequately staffed and records of meetings and decisions made in the Single Point of Access are not documented. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 14 May 2025.</span> I, Kate Robertson, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Family of the Deceased and to the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, [REDACTED], Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, The Lodge, Lodge Approach, Runwell, Wickford, SS11 7XX 1 CORONER I am Sean Horstead, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Essex 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 31 st October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of DARREN NEIL TURNER, aged 37 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a 9- day article 2 non-jury inquest on the 28 th February 2025. Darren Neil Turner was found deceased on 20 th October 2023 in a wooded area in Essex. The evidence disclosed that the deceased likely took his own life on the morning of the 18 th October 2023. The medical cause of death was confirmed as ‘1a Hanging'. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medication + concerns + care + care + care + assessment + ambulance + intoxicated">In a narrative conclusion I recorded that the deceased took his own life in the context of multiple failures in the care, management and treatment provided to him by the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) and that those serious failings amounted to neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH: On the 23 rd September 2023 after concerns were raised that Darren, at his home address, was threatening to take his own life having consumed a potential overdose of medication whilst intoxicated with alcohol, the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) and Essex Police attended and attempted to facilitate a medical assessment of Darren.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: mental health">The following day, whilst apparently experiencing a serious mental health crisis, Darren caused extensive damage, and set fire, to the home he had shared with his former long-term partner, in what was an attempt to end his life.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + care + assessment + patient">He was arrested and detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and, following an assessment, was subsequently detained under Section 2 of the MHA and admitted as an in- patient to Gosfield Ward, an Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Lakes Mental Health Unit, Colchester, Essex under the care of EPUT on 26 th September.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Although Darren had no significant previous recorded history of mental health problems, he did have a history of alcohol misuse which had worsened over the two to three years preceding his death whilst working from home as a consequence of the Covid pandemic.</span> A trigger for events in September 2023 appears to have been the ending of his long-term relationship, itself a consequence of Darren's drinking. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The evidence disclosed multiple significant failings in the care, management and treatment of the deceased up to and including the rescinding of his Section 2 MHA detention and subsequent discharge from Gosfield Ward at around 2 pm on the 17 th October 2023.</span> These failings, individually and cumulatively, more than minimally contributed to his self-inflicted death by hanging within some 18 hours or so of the rescinding of the Section 2 detention and Darren's discharge. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: concerns + informed">Taken together, the causative failures identified during the course of the inquest constituted gross failures and, accordingly, led to a finding that neglect contributed to Darren's avoidable death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS: A significant number of the serious causative failings identified in this case have previously informed PFDRs issued to EPUT.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: analysis + between + between">In June 2024 a ‘Thematic Analysis' Review Document prepared by EPUT's ‘Lessons Team' identified ‘Triangulated Themes' from a review of nine PFDRs issued in the Essex Coronial jurisdiction between June 2021 and January 2024.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors 
Keywords: supervision + communication, concerns + care + care + care planning, care, planning + risk assessment, risk, assessment + training + training + training">The Review acknowledged six ‘Triangulated Themes' in respect of which failures causative of deaths had been, and continued to be, identified, namely: Communication; Training & Supervision; Record Keeping; Discharge Planning; Care Planning; Risk Assessment . (Further PFDRs issued to EPUT in October 2024 and February 2025 raised similar, related concerns).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">During Darren's inquest continuing failings under precisely the themes identified emerged once more as having informed the serious causative features contributing to Darren's death.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: inadequate + risk">In my opinion, the actions taken by EPUT to date to address the acknowledged failings reflected under the themes referred to have been, and remain, inadequate and incomplete; Accordingly, during the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and, in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: care + care + care planning, care, planning + policy">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (a) Failures in Care Planning: specifically, a failure to appropriately up-date and document matters relating to Darren's Care Plan consistent with Trust policy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: care + inadequate, care + care + risk assessment, risk, assessment + patient + policy">The last up-date to his Care Plan was 12 days prior to discharge. (b) Failures in Documentation: in a number of acknowledged respects the electronic records were inadequate - and inconsistent with EPUT policy - with evidence of the ‘cutting and pasting' of entries including Darren's initial 72-hour care plan containing details of another patient entirely. (c) Failures in Risk Assessments: specifically, failures to appropriately up-date and document matters relating to Darren's risk assessment consistent with Trust policy.</span> <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: factors + risk">Relevant passive and active risk factors were not formally reflected in his documented risk assessments.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: care + care + care + policy">Evidence from his Responsible Consultant Psychiatrist and the discharging Psychiatrist confirmed that, had they been aware of a disclosure made by Darren to his key worker/nurse prior to discharge, the Section 2 detention would not have been rescinded, he would not have been discharged on the 17 th October and, accordingly, it is likely that he would not have taken his own life the following day. (d) Failure to allocate a Care Coordinator as required under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and as mandated by EPUT policy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: safety + communication + planning">This failure (resulting from significant human error not detected by an insufficiently robust system and not therefore corrected prior to the death- and in respect of which no DATIX was ever raised) was a feature that contributed to the serious failure in discharge planning in this case. (e) Failures in Communication including a failure to appropriately liaise with the deceased's Family and, specifically, Darren's mother to establish the suitability and safety of a discharge to her address not least in the context of Darren's disclosure that discharge to his mother's home might "make him feel worse" at a point in time that he later acknowledged "would be overwhelming" for him. (f) Failures in Discharge Planning and Execution: specifically, in addition to the features above, a failure to actively reconsider the safety of the discharge on the afternoon of the 17 th October in light of the disclosure from Darren's mother that she would not, as had been previously indicated, be able to either collect Darren from the Ward or be at her home when he was discharged.</span> There was no evidence of how, in fact, Darren even left the Unit. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy">It is likely that the chaotic and unsupported nature of Darren's discharge from Gosfield Ward, also in breach of Trust policy, more than minimally contributed to his death some 18 hours after discharge. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 12 th May 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 HM Area Coroner for Essex Sean Horstead 17.03.2025

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Director General Chief Executive Officer of His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) Chief Executive Officer of NHS England Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing & Chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council Chief Executive Officer of NHS Dorset 1 CORONER I am Rachael Clare Griffin, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Dorset. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 16 th December 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Marta Elena Vento, born on the 26 th March 1993 who was aged 27 years at the time of her death.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 28 th February 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: mental health + care + guidance + care + care + national, guidance">The medical cause of death was: Ia Multiple blunt force head injuries The conclusion of the Inquest was the following narrative conclusion: "Marta Elena Vento was unlawfully killed by another who at the time of her death was unmedicated for a diagnosed mental health illness because of a failure to sufficiently plan and ensure the continuity of his mental health care upon his release from prison 6 weeks prior to Marta's death, and because he was not adequately managed as a sex offender in line with national guidance upon his release from prison." 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On the 9th December 2020, Marta was working alone as a receptionist at the Travelodge Hotel, 43 Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, when at 05.12 hours she was relentlessly beaten in the most violent manner by another in a sudden and unprovoked attack in the bar/café area at the hotel.</span> At the time of Marta's death, the perpetrator was actively psychotic due to being unmedicated for psychosis. The perpetrator of Marta's death was released from prison on the 27th October 2020, 6 weeks prior to her death. His release was unexpected at that time to those working in the prison and prison healthcare. Whilst in prison he was diagnosed with psychosis and when unmediated was unpredictable and violent. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

Keywords: between + between">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The perpetrator of Marta's death was a remand prisoner at HMP Winchester between the 9th of July and the 27th of October 2020.</span> He was released on the 27 th October 2020 unexpectedly after a video link hearing before the Magistrates Court at which he was sentenced and immediately released. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: medication + mental health">During the period of his remand, the perpetrator was diagnosed with serious mental health illness for which he received medication.</span> This treated his psychotic symptoms, one of which was that he undertook violent acts when unmedicated. During the period of remand he assaulted 4 individuals, including two prison officers, whilst unmedicated. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: concerns + review + documentation">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Although HMP Rochester had addressed many of the concerns raised by the PPO in advance of the inquest, evidence was given at the inquest that some officers chairing reviews did not read relevant documentation beyond the last ACCT review prior to the review taking place.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: review + record">Although they additionally looked at the last CSIP review where the processes were running in tandem, they did not read the ongoing record or Nomis case notes and were unable to conduct an accurate assessment of risk as a result (2) Some of the officers chairing reviews did not understand how to complete the support plan paperwork such that the ACCT was closed when some of the support plans had not started or had not been completed 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Governor HMP Rochester have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 th May 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] , Chief Executive (Bradford District Care NHS Trust) 1 CORONER I am Angela BROCKLEHURST, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Yorkshire Western Coroner Area 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 February 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Andrea Denise MANN aged 61.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Upon the 10th February 2024, at her home address, Andrea Denise Mann was discovered by a member of her family, to be hanging from a noose placed around her neck [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: care + care + care + ambulance">Mrs Mann was released from her position, and transported by the Ambulance Service to Bradford Royal Infirmary where she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.</span> Despite receiving advanced life support the medical condition of Mrs Mann did not improve. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + care + between + between">Following discussions between attending clinicians and the family of Mrs Mann, a decision was made to withdraw invasive medical care, with Palliative Care then being provided to her.</span> Sadly, the death of Mrs Mann was certified at the hospital on the 11th February 2024 at 14.44 hours. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Andrea was found by her husband, hanging [REDACTED]. Emergency services attended, CPR commenced and she was admitted to hospital. She was admitted to hospital, but sadly the following day she was weaned from the ventilator, as family felt that she would not wish to continue with ICU invasive therapy if she would not be able to return to her previous level of function. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">She passed away a few hours later. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Private vs. NHS Care Integration + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

                        <td>The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The findings made by myself at the Inquest include the following; 1) That during the period of her involvement with the Community Mental Health Trust between the period 25/04/2023 and 04/12/2023 the care given to the deceased was limited to 2 appointments only within which she was referred back to her GP for medication adjustment which had been seen to be ineffective, and referral to Psychological therapy sessions which had a waiting period of 6 months despite an earlier private consultation having been proved ineffective, That the frequent requests of the deceased and her family for a Psychiatric appointment had not been provided to her, with the result that the deceased had to seek a private consultation. 2) That no evidence of any overarching management tool existed to provide scrutiny of the care given to the deceased, or measure the success or efficacy of such care, and as such there were many lost opportunities to provide to the deceased and her family sufficient, consistent, controlled and bespoke care. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by April 29, 2025.</td>

Keywords: mental health + between + between + mental health">I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + decisions + care + care + mental health">This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co-ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community - which is in fact what happened in this case.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + patient + mental health">I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care.</span> This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board (‘SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: patient + patient">It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a "high risk area" for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii.</span> The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v.</span> Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is " the way forward " as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this "way forward" expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)

Keywords: high-risk">The cumulative effect (there ‘seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1 st May 2025.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period.

CCTV confirmed he returned to the property at 02.48 on 11/07/23 and was seen in the garden area having an altercation with Mr Lynch around 05.30 before at 05.51 he is seen on CCTV striking Mr Lynch with force.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Multiple sharp force injuries 1b 1c 1d II 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

This was a critical issue as the new address had not been updated on the clinical notes. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + care + staff + staff + mental health">The evidence demonstrated there is a continuing risk that All Care In One Ltd staff will not recognise and take appropriate action when a service user presents with serious acute mental health issues.</span> For example: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + care + staff + staff + mental health">At a fundamental level staff did not understand what is in the best interests of a service user: (a) Carers did not want to embarrass Javed, therefore they felt justified in making repetitive inaccurate contemporaneous records recording behaviour and mood was well despite having serious concerns about his worsening mental health and triggering an urgent call to his GP; (b) Then, having contacted the GP two days before his death, the care co-ordinator did not action the request from the GP to send an email setting out these serious concerns in writing. 2.</span> There was no formal internal post-death investigation report. 3. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Northumberland Childrens and Adults Safeguarding Partnership 1 CORONER I am Mr Robert Cohen, HM Assistant Coroner for Cumbria 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 April 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Janet Scott.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was Janet Scott was 60 years old. She lived in Haltwhistle, Northumbria. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

Ms Scott lived in social housing. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment
Keywords: needs + physical">She required regular support with her mental and physical health needs.</span> She struggled to maintain her home and ensure that it remained clean and safe. Ms Scott was at serious risk of self-neglect. In 2022 attempts began to rehouse Ms Scott. Unfortunately, it was not easy to identify a suitable alternative address in the small area in which she was willing to live. As a result, she remained at the same address until a scheduled move in March 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">On 7th March 2023 Ms Scott's Community Psychiatric Nurse (‘CPN') contacted Adult Social Care.</span> She had been allowed entry into Ms Scott's home and was very concerned. She described ‘squalor': a property full of rubbish bags, with a build-up of food parcels that Ms Scott was not using. On that day, Ms Scott had been kneeling when she answered the door. On the next day, Ms Scott was visited by her support worker. She was observed to be dishevelled, exhibiting poor personal hygiene and struggling to walk. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: agency">Following these encounters, there was a failure to activate multi-agency safeguarding procedures.</span> Multiple attempts were made to contact ASC over the coming days, but these were not responded to with sufficient speed or rigour. Ms Scott was visited on 20th March 2023 but no immediate risk to her was recognised. Ms Scott was found at home, unresponsive, on 28th March 2023. She had developed sepsis. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: conditions">It is more likely than not that Ms Scott's self-neglect, her living conditions in the last weeks of her life, and the very limited medical assistance provided to her in those weeks caused or contributed to Ms Scott's death.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: conditions">She was a ‘hoarder' and her living conditions were seriously unsanitary.</span> She was also without a functioning boiler for 18 months after her gas supply was capped. Prior to Ms Scott's death there were numerous occasions on which her self-neglect was apparent to different agencies. Although it is true that Ms Scott was often unwilling to accept help, I heard evidence of several occasions on which there had been missed opportunities to provide assistance. To their substantial credit, many of the agencies involved in Ms Scott's situation provided evidence to me of the steps they have taken to avoid a repeat. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: agency">There was a consensus that more could and should have been done to adopt a multi-agency approach to safeguarding. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors 
Keywords: informed + staff + staff + training + referral + training + training">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Although individual agencies referred me to training they had provided to staff since Ms Scott's death, I also received evidence that, for instance, the GP surgery might not raise a safeguarding referral if the same circumstances were repeated because social services had already been informed.</span> This leads me to be concerned that the message that ‘safeguarding is everyone's responsibility' has not been taken on board. I am concerned that future cases will occur in which a multiagency approach is not adopted or that individuals will not make safeguarding referrals because they assume that other agencies are already aware of the issue. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Northumberland Childrens and Adults Safeguarding Partnership have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18th April 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to each of the Interested Persons. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner 9 20 February 2025 Signature Robert Cohen HM Assistant Coroner for Cumbria

Roughly four months before her death Amy had undergone an emergency alcohol detoxification in a hospital setting whilst on the waiting list for alcohol services from a third sector agency. Amy had engaged with a number of third sector agencies in the two years before her death to help with her alcohol addiction, but her engagement had been sporadic, and she often disengaged. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

Attending paramedics and Police confirmed the death at 06.50hrs. I am satisfied that Amy took her own life and intended to do so. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased Amy Marie Padley. Amy Marie Padley suffered from alcohol addiction and depression and was diagnosed with an EUPD.

Keywords: mental health + access">In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows: I am concerned about the evidence I heard in this inquest that when an individual is suffering from alcohol or drug addiction alongside a mental health diagnosis, which in this case was EUPD and depression, that the focus of SUBHB is normally to advise that individual to address their addiction before they can access mental health services.</span> I heard that addiction services do not fall within the remit of SUBHB and are provided by third-sector agencies. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + risk">I heard that individuals who have a mental health diagnosis may self -medicate to manage symptoms of a mental health deterioration and that increased use of alcohol/drugs can increase the risk of self-harm to such individuals which may prove fatal.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: mental health + respect + guidance + staff + staff + guidance">I am concerned that there is no guidance to staff within SBUHB on how to manage individuals with addiction and a mental health diagnosis and how SUBHB staff should liaise with and work alongside third-sector agencies in respect of an individual suffering from addiction.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: mental health + access">I am also concerned that there appears to be a reluctance within SBUHB to offer mental health support alongside suggesting that an individual access addiction services.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + risk, assessment">I am concerned that this may mean that individuals in mental health crisis and suffering from addiction may not be getting the mental health assessment and support that they require alongside seeking to overcome their addiction and as such there is continuing risk to life. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 st April 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Keywords: mental health + risk + patient + manager">The director who was spokesperson for the Mental Health Trust did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of these deficits. a) A mental health liaison nurse, who now is manager of these nurses, did not recognize the patient as high risk, despite his having been persuaded to attend A&E by the police against his will, having just expressed suicidal ideation, made a previous attempt, with alcohol intoxication and absconsion, as at the time he denied suicidality.</span> Even in retrospect in court she did not acknowledge her misjudgement. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

This report is being sent to: British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy | North London NHS Foundation Trust
Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths Report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Chief Executive Officer British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) BACP House St John's Business Park Lutterworth Leicestershire LE17 4HB 2. Chief Executive Officer North London NHS Foundation Trust St Pancras Hospital 4 St Pancras Way London NW1 0PE 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 August 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Duncan Holloway, aged 36 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 January 2025. I do apologise for the late provision of this report. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Holloway jumped off a bridge at approximately 5am on Thursday, 18 July 2024 and was killed by the impact with the railway tracks below. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. For BCAP: 1. Mr Holloway's BCAP accredited psychotherapist did not make any notes of her consultations with him, because he had asked her not to. She gave evidence that she is not bound by law or ethics to keep any notes. Is it appropriate that there is no minimum standard of note keeping following psychotherapy consultations? 2. The psychotherapist said that she had never before had a client who was suicidal. She said that this is not taught at university, though she had completed a post graduate course in working with suicidal ideation. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors

[REDACTED], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police 1 CORONER I am Sarah Bourke, HM Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Inner North London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 4 October 2023, Assistant Coroner Smith commenced an investigation into the death of Ronald Bainborough aged 52 years.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2024. The jury made a natural causes conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach.

Keywords: mental health + assessment + mental health">Following a failed attempt to informally assess Mr Bainborough under the Mental Health Act on 5 June 2023, it was decided to apply for a warrant under Section 135(1) Mental Health Act so that Mr Bainborough could be detained to enable an assessment to take place.</span> There were significant delays in applying for a warrant for reasons specific to the circumstances of this case. An application for a warrant was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023 and the warrant was granted at a hearing on 23 August. Once a warrant was issued, an appointment was made for police officers to execute the warrant on 7 September 2023. Before the warrant could be executed, Mr Bainborough was admitted to hospital on 29 August 2023 suffering from malnutrition. He had a BMI of around 13. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

The medical cause of his death was: 1a) community acquired pneumonia and malnutrition; 1b) anorexia and chronic schizophrenia; 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: mental health + mental health">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) During the Inquest, evidence was heard from 2 consultant psychiatrists and an Approved Mental Health Act Professional (AMHP) regarding the timescales for applying for and executing s135(1) warrants.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: concerns + time">All of them had concerns about the time taken for a warrant to be issued and executed (2) The warrant application was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023, the hearing took place on 23 August and it was intended that the warrant would be executed on 7 September 2023.</span> This was a timescale of 20 days. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The jury was told that this timescale was typical of the time taken to apply for and execute a s135(1) warrant in the experience of the professionals giving evidence at the Inquest. (3) Applications for a warrant are heard at Westminster and Uxbridge Magistrates Courts which consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: needs">There are a limited number of video hearing slots, so AMPH teams may have to wait several days for a hearing. (4) Once a warrant has been issued, an appointment then needs to be arranged for police officers to execute the warrant.</span> The evidence before the court was that it would generally take in the region of 10 days for an appointment to be scheduled. (5) There is no official fast track procedure. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + time + risk, assessment + mental health">Consequently, there is a risk of harm to the individual and others during the time taken for a warrant to be granted and executed. (6) As individuals have been identified as requiring assessment under the Mental Health Act, the risk of potential harm is recognised.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

[REDACTED], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police 1 CORONER I am Sarah Bourke, HM Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Inner North London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 19 October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Zahra Sharif Mohamed aged 53 years.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 August 2024. The jury returned a suicide conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach.

On 4 October, she sent text messages to her children's social worker threatening to kill her children and expressing the need to return to hospital. Attempts were made to persuade Mrs Mohamed to return to hospital voluntarily but she refused. Over the following days, she expressed suicidal thoughts and threatened to jump from the balcony outside her 5 th floor flat to professionals. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) It was accepted that a s135(2) warrant should have been applied for on 4 October 2022. However, if an application had been submitted to the magistrates' court that day, it is unlikely that the warrant would have been executed before Mrs Mohamed's death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + informed + time + mental health">In evidence, I was informed by a number of mental health professionals that the time taken for a s135(2) warrant to be obtained from the magistrates' court and executed by the police was in the region of 2 weeks. (2) The process for obtaining a warrant is that an application has to be made for a video hearing at either Uxbridge or Westminster Magistrates' Courts.</span> It could take several days for a hearing to be arranged as the courts consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: mental health + informed + risk + patient + team + mental health + team">Once the Magistrates issued a warrant, an appointment would then be arranged for the police to execute the warrant. (3) I was informed that a 2-week timescale for obtaining s135(2) warrants was still the case in the summer of 2024. (4) I also heard evidence that the mental health team could attend Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in person to apply for a warrant in urgent cases but that they were actively discouraged from using this process by the court. (5) The court heard that the process and timescale for issuing and executing warrants had led to the hospital team adopting a practice of asking the community team to encourage a patient to return to hospital voluntarily before making an application for a warrant. (6) There is an ongoing risk that patients will harm themselves or others in the period before the warrant can be executed.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

(4) I also heard evidence that the mental health team could attend Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in person to apply for a warrant in urgent cases but that they were actively discouraged from using this process by the court. (5) The court heard that the process and timescale for issuing and executing warrants had led to the hospital team adopting a practice of asking the community team to encourage a patient to return to hospital voluntarily before making an application for a warrant. (6) There is an ongoing risk that patients will harm themselves or others in the period before the warrant can be executed.</td>

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 February 2025.

This report is being sent to: Royal College of Psychiatrists
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists 21 Prescot Street London E1 8BB 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS Nicholas J'Dourou (date of birth 29 August 1977) died on 15 April 2024, whilst admitted as a voluntary patient at Highgate Acute Mental Health Centre (‘Highgate').</span> He died from asphyxiation which arose from the placement of a ligature around his neck. His death was contributed to by a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">I heard the inquest into his death on 24 January 2025 and reached the conclusion of suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Nicholas had long-standing mental health diagnoses and had been detained under the Mental Health Act on several previous occasions.</span> His mood deteriorated at the beginning of 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

Keywords: staff">He was under ‘general observations', meaning that staff were supposed to be monitoring him on an hourly basis.</span> Sadly, on the late morning of the 15 April, he was found in his room with a ligature around his neck. Signs indicated that he died several hours previously. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff

Keywords: concerns">However, it was not possible to conclude that this lack of monitoring contributed to his death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Nicholas' death were as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: medication + care + guidance + care + care + national, local, guidance">I heard evidence that cross-titration of medication, when changing from one regimen to another, is commonplace in psychiatric care but that how to undertake this process is determined predominantly by each individual prescriber's own practice, rather than any local or national guidance.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + local, guidance">The local psychiatric Trust provided evidence that they were in the process of developing local guidance.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">However, this was proving to be complicated, owing to the range of settings in which cross-titration may be carried-out (i.e. primary care, community psychiatry care, in-patient care), the complexity of the medications prescribed and a lack of evidence regarding how this should be undertaken.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">I am concerned that this commonplace and important process is seemingly undertaken on the basis of limited consensus and that the variation in care provided could result in future deaths. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">I heard evidence that the local psychiatric Trust had undertaken a trial of electronic patient observation (i.e. automated monitoring of respiratory rate, temperature) but that this had been discontinued, owing to patient complaints regarding invasion of privacy.</span> The issue of privacy and electronic monitoring on psychiatric wards is clearly a complex issue. However, in circumstances such as Nicholas' death, I am concerned that the lack of patient observation could result in future deaths. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: concerns + guidance + local, guidance">Regarding both of the above concerns, I heard evidence that the Royal College of Psychiatrists has not produced any formal guidance regarding cross-titration and use of electronic monitoring and that decision-making is ad hoc, based on individual/local practice. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressee has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 April 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, Nicholas' family, the hospital Trust and the CQC. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive of Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Gareth Jones HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Sussex and Brighton and Hove. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Harry Benjamin SOUTHERN aged 19.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Harry Southern died on the 12th of October 2023 at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. He tied a ligature around his neck the day before which led to hypoxic brain injury. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the course of the Inquest, evidence was provided of the many services available to young men such as Harry who have attempted suicide including services such as the Haven and numbers they can contact if they are suicidal. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">However, I am concerned that this information is not in fact provided to people in Harry's circumstances.</span> Evidence was heard from Harry's father that indicated that in fact the contact numbers are not answered and do not cater for those with hearing difficulties or other disabilities. Young people in particular are not aware of other services such as Papyrus, a charity that has a round the clock suicide prevention helpline aimed at young people who are suicidal. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust [REDACTED], GP at Carden Surgery in Brighton [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (all family members) I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it.

This report is being sent to: Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 CEO, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Robert SIMPSON, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Berkshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 09 February 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jan Michael RACIBORSKI aged 62.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 5th February 2024 Jan Michael Raciborski died at his home address in Caversham after he hung himself. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">He had suffered with mental health issues for the majority of his life which, along with the impact of a brain injury resulting from an historic attempt to end his life, significantly affected his mood and decision making processes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Raciborski suffered from depression and a brain injury for many years.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: care + care + care">He had many contacts with them during his final period of care.</span> He had a history of impulsive actions and intermittent suicidal thoughts. In August 2023 his condition deteriorated before then improving. In November 2023 this happened again and this presentation was in keeping with a pattern over the years. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: mental health + team + team">In January 2024 he had a fleeting thought of suicide and was assessed by a mental health team in London.</span> He subsequently had contact with his local AMHT. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He remained distressed over the following days until he was found deceased on the 5 th February 2024. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) None of the records of contact with Mr Raciborski completed by the AMHT in the period from August 2023 to the date of Mr Raciborski's death contained any written record of a risk assessment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_External - Societal factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: treatment + factor + factor + factor">I found that in Mr Raciborski's case this absence did not impact his treatment and was not a causative factor.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: information + inadequate + record">However my concern is that the failure to properly record the details of a risk assessment can lead to inadequate information sharing and the possibility of someone who relies upon the records gaining the wrong impression.</span> In addition it does not allow the adequacy of the risk assessments to be properly investigated and could hinder investigations into deaths; which mean that a matter giving rise to a risk to life may not be identified in future investigations. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 07, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Mr Raciborski's family. I have also sent it to who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 10/01/2025 Robert SIMPSON Assistant Coroner for Berkshire

[REDACTED] Chief Executive, NHS England, Quarry House, Quarry Hill, Leeds, LS2 7UE via email [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Lisa Milner, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex, Brighton and Hove. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Morgan Rose Betchley, formerly Sladovic, aged 19 years. The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 22 nd November 2024. The conclusion given by the jury was a narrative conclusion namely: Morgan died as a result of her own actions. Historical evidence suggests that in all probability Morgan's intent had been to self-harm as a cry for help and that it was not her intention to end her life. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

Keywords: informed, decisions + lacking + staff + staff">The clinical staff at HMP Coldingley were lacking this initiative and curiosity and thereby missed a pattern of behaviour that they could have identified and used to drive better-informed clinical decisions at point such as the brief CSU rounds and reviews.</span> When the allegation that led to Haydar's recall was no longer being pursued, there was an opportunity for the Secretary of State to consider an executive release, which was not taken. The IPP parole decision could have been made on "on papers" without the need for a meeting, and this too was declined. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

It is accepted that only two observations were conducted per hour. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Haydar Jefferies was sentenced to imprisonment for public protection ("IPP") in 2006. He was released in 2013. Haydar then integrated into the community, married and was working as a publican. Following the death of his spouse and his father in 2021 Haydar attempted suicide. In January 2022 allegations were made against him and he was recalled to prison under the terms of the IPP. By April 2022 the allegations were not being pursued. An Executive Release order request was made and declined. ln order to be released from prison Haydar had to attend a parole board hearing. The parole board decided that a hearing in person was required. In May 2022 Haydar disclosed he had made a ligature. A parole board hearing was fixed on the 13th October 2022.The parole board hearing was vacated owing to the unavailability of the chair person. The next parole hearing was listed for the 2nd March 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: communication + care + care + between + between + referral + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Throughout the inquest, it was apparent that save for the referral by the Urology team to the Pain Service in September 2023, there was no liaison or communication between any of the specialties involved in Mr Williamson's care, which resulted in a lack of understanding on the part of each specialty of the plans and actions of the others.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + mental health">The inquest was told that there is a significant proportion of patients who are referred to the Pain Service who suffer poor mental health and who are therefore also under the care of mental health teams in the community.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: communication + care + care + geographical + between + between + locally, nationally">The inquest heard that there is no formal framework (other than in cancer care and one specialist area of surgery) either locally or nationally to facilitate inter-specialty communication, particularly in complex and dynamic cases and further, that the existing channels of communication are more problematic between different NHS Trusts even within the same geographical area. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 th February 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

This report is being sent to: NHS England
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: NHS England By Email 1 CORONER I am Samantha GOWARD, Area Coroner for the coroner area of Norfolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Oliver James WINSON aged 33.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Keywords: medication">He had previously been diagnosed with a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder for which he was prescribed medication.</span> In 2017 he was referred to the adult ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) service as his GP was concerned that his attention span was limited, and he had become quite hyperactive. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: concerns + information">In a response to a request for further information, his GP confirmed that Mr Winson had been concerned for many years about his low attention span and found it difficult to concentrate and there were concerns that this might point to hyperactivity and drug related behaviour.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">He had a history of impulsive behaviour, and this led to a risk of him becoming aggressive and a risk of going back to significant drug abusing behaviour.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: care + care + time + team + referral + team">As Mr Winson was under the care of the drug and alcohol service it was felt that someone in that team could see him so the referral was not accepted at that time.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: mental health + assessment + team + mental health + team">However, the service misuse team referred Mr Winson back to the mental health Trust on 19th June 2020 for an adult ADHD undiagnosed assessment.</span> They confirmed that he had been abstinent from drugs for four to five years and was on daily methadone. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor

Keywords: time">At that time, it was indicated that the waiting list was likely to be in the region of two years.</span> The substance misuse service regularly sought updates on the waiting list and were advised that this was very lengthy due to unprecedented referrals and that the COVID pandemic had also impacted on this. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Secretary of State Department of Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Nigel Parsley, Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of Suffolk. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 6 February 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Timothy Robert DE BOOS The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 December 2024.</span> The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- The effects of a self-ignited fire at his home address, whilst suffering a relapse of his known psychotic illness. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Smoke inhalation and severe burns 1b Domestic fire 2 Paranoid schizophrenia, severe right coronary artery atherosclerosis 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Timothy De Boos was declared deceased at his home address in Ipswich, Suffolk on the 6′′ February 2024. Earlier that day a fire had to be seen coming from the ground floor flat of the address. Tim was seen by a witness to close the window of the flat whilst it was on fire, then disappear from view. Tim made no attempt to leave, and when found was sat or slumped against the door of the room. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: mental health + unwell">Timothy was known to the mental health services, and had a prolonged history of being mentally unwell (being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2004), with evidence of a previous stated suicidal thought.</span> A subsequent post-mortem examination identified that Tim had died from smoke inhalation and burns. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: · Secretary of State for Health · NHS England 1 CORONER I am Penelope Schofield, Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex and Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 rd November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Zak Sheldrick (Matty).</span> Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them. The investigation concluded with the Inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 th December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">At the end of the Inquest, I concluded that: On 3rd November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health.</span> This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Later on 4th November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them.</span> Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished. However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear. The following issues contributed to their death:- 1. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: not suitable">The fact that Matty's private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues. 2.</span> The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between">They stayed in the Accident and Emergency department for 26 days during their admission between 5th and 30th September 2022.</span> This meant that there was no meaningful therapeutic input at that time. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment
Keywords: mental health + environment">The fact that Accident and Emergency Department was not a suitable environment for a neurodivergent individual and the 26-day period of their stay contributed to the deterioration of their mental health difficulties. 4.</span> The fact that there was a general lack of inpatient bed provision for informal patients and in particular for those who are autistic and non- binary who require to be on a mixed ward. 5. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: treatment + assessment + team">The fact that Matty was discharged from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team on 18th October 2022 before being picked up by Assessment and Treatment Service.</span> This left a gap in service provision for Matty. 6. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Escalation/referral factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive Integrated Care Board 1 CORONER I am Penelope Schofield, Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex and Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 rd November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Zak Sheldrick (Matty).</span> Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them. The investigation concluded with the Inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 th December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">At the end of the Inquest, I concluded that: On 3rd November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health.</span> This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Later on 4th November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them.</span> Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished. However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear. The following issues contributed to their death:- 1. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: not suitable">The fact that Matty's private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues. 2.</span> The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">The lack of inpatient beds leading to the unacceptable wait time in A&E for those suffering with their mental health who are awaiting beds.</span> In Matty's case a bed was not found for them within a 26-day period. 2. There being a shortage of beds for Autistic patients (both informal and detained) within the private sector that are being funded by the ICB. Evidence was heard that those providing beds within the public sector very often refused to accept autistic patients due to their additional risks. 3. There being a shortage of beds for transgender patients who are in need of a mixed ward. 4. In Matty's case it appears there was a lack of appreciation by the ICB of his extensive length of stay in A&E. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

[REDACTED], CEO, North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT), CEME Centre, March Way, Rainham, Essex, RM13 8GQ Email: [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Nadia Persaud area coroner for the coroner area of East London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 19 March 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dean Martin Ford (aged 40).</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 2 December 2024.

Emergency services were called and paramedics pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. There were no substances found on toxicology which would have prevented Mr. Ford from forming an intention to take his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: mental health + care, clear + guidance + factor + risk + guidance + team, factor + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Despite clear guidance from NICE in September 2022 relating to the need for a holistic formulation of risk to self, two NELFT teams involved in Mr Ford's crisis care failed to carry out a holistic formulation of the risk he posed to himself. (2) A clinical lead for the mental health and wellbeing team within NELFT, gave evidence at the inquest in December 2024 that Mr Ford's risk was deemed to be low because "the main factor around risk is that he denied any risk to self and denied any suicidal thoughts".</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

(3) The Trust carries out risk assessment audits for clients who are accepted into the mental health and wellbeing team.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the family and partner of Mr Ford. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

As a train approached the platform shortly after 9.00am Daniela jumped onto the tracks and was struck by the train. The impact caused a severe head injury and Daniela was sadly declared deceased at the scene. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Concerns regarding the train station After Daniela's death British Transport Police (BTP) prepared a ‘Post Incident Site Report'. I understand that this report was undertaken in conjunction with the station operator; in this case South Western Railways, and Network Rail. This report detailed a number of potential problems at [REDACTED] and proposed mitigation measures. These included: 1. A lack of Samaritan signs on the platforms or within the stations. The mitigation proposed was conspicuously placed posters and/or additional signage. 2. Car park line side fencing being too low. The proposed mitigation was replacement of the fencing. The report was submitted on the 25th July 2023. Despite the passage of nearly 9 months from submission of the report to the date of the inquest the BTP officer giving evidence could not inform me whether these changes had been actioned. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">I was advised that this information had been requested from South Western Railways but had not been provided.</span> On the 18th March 2024 I requested an update from BTP about the actions taken and invited them to attend the final hearing on the 25th March 2024. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The family of Miss Pani I have also sent it to Network Rail who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Clare House Surgery, Newport St, Tiverton EX16 6NJ 2. Royal Pharmaceutical Society, 66 East Smithfield, London E1W 1AW 3. Pharmacy2U Limited, Lumina, Park Approach, Thorpe Park, Leeds LS15 8GB 1 CORONER I am Luisa Maria Nicholson, HM Assistant Coroner for Devon, Plymouth & Torbay 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 7 th December 2023 an investigation into the death of Oliver James Billings aged 22 was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 th November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Billings' death was due to suicide. The medical cause of his death was established as 1a) Toxic effect of [REDACTED]. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Oliver was found deceased at his home address on 6 th December 2023 having consumed possibly as many as 266 x 75mg tablets of his prescribed [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: medication + local + pharmacy">It appears that he had hoarded some of his medication and also appears to have acquired 112 tablets on or around 29 th November 2023 due to a prescribing error where he changed his choice of chemist from an online pharmacy (‘Pharmacy2U') to a local ‘Superdrug' store.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">His Surgery, Clare House Surgery, Tiverton sent an electronic request to Pharmacy2U to cancel the prescription and then issued the second to Superdrug; however, Pharmacy2U had already "pulled down" the prescription before it was cancelled electronically.</span> They then dispatched 112 x 75mg [REDACTED] to Oliver by post on 28 th November. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">This meant that Oliver was still able to collect the second prescription for 112 x 75mg [REDACTED] from Superdrug and was suddenly in possession of 224 tablets.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">The Surgery sent Oliver a text message asking him to contact Pharmacy2U to "return the prescription to the spine" which presumably he chose to ignore.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: mental health + mental health + issues">He had a long-established history of issues with his mental health including anxiety, depression, self-harm and previous suicidal ideation.</span> He was also aware of his own impulsiveness. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">A note was found by a police officer attending Oliver's flat on the day he died which stated that he did not have control over his medication and would take them all if left unsupervised.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">This is sadly what appears to have happened. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication, prescription">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) That a subsequent prescription was submitted in the knowledge that the first was cancelled or to be cancelled but that steps do not appear to have been taken or be able to be taken to ascertain the status of that prescription before the subsequent prescription was issued. (2) That the swift dispatch of medication (whilst admittedly necessary in many circumstances) does not allow for mistakes to be noticed and/or remedied. (3) That the onus was on Oliver to remedy the error when Pharmacy2U could not be contacted. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24 th January 2025 .</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Oliver's parents, Mr and Mrs Billings. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: medication, prescription + mental health + mental health">The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- Suicide as the result of a deterioration in her mental health, exacerbated by an ineffective PRN medication prescription which failed to resolve her heightened anxiety crisis when needed.</span> The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Fatal Pressure on Neck 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Amy Butcher was declared deceased at 07:26 hours on the 14 th May 2023 at [REDACTED] in Suffolk.

Keywords: prescription + mental health + team + mental health + team">Following her discharge Amy had consultations with her mental health crisis team and her GP, and made repeated requests for a prescription of Lorazepam, to take as a PRN medicine, if she suffered a further heightened anxiety crisis.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Taking a PRN medication was one of the steps identified in Amy's agreed crisis plan.</span> Amy's request for Lorazepam was declined, and alternative PRN medications where subsequently prescribed. On the evening of the 13 th May 2024 Amy was particularly distressed, and it took her partner hours to calm her down, until Amy finally fell asleep. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + Extended Analysis_Medication safety

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)

Keywords: mental health + team + mental health + team">The Emergency Department Consultant who saw Amy in crisis on the 10 th May 2024 stated that for patients like Amy she had previously prescribed Lorazepam upon discharge home, but could only do this if the Mental Health Team in the ED requested her to do so, which they did not do on this occasion.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

Keywords: medication + mental health + mental health">She spoke to a mental health practitioner who told her that NHS 111 Option 2 did not have the ability to prescribe medication, and she would need to call NHS 111 Option 1 and speak to an Out of Hours GP instead.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">Amy contacted NHS 111 Option 1 and spoke to an Out of Hours GP, who worked for a private company which had implemented a ban on the prescription of Lorazepam due to its highly addictive properties.</span> As such, even if the GP had considered Lorazepam to be required in Amy's case, he could not have prescribed it. The GP prescribed different PRN medications, which were subsequently found in Amy's system after her death. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

Keywords: mental health + team + mental health + team">Evidence was heard that a decision had been made by the Mental Health Multi-Disciplinary Team that Lorazepam was not to be prescribed to Amy in any event.</span> The court heard that Lorazepam was highly addictive and the subject of frequent misuse by individuals to whom it was prescribed.

Keywords: mental health + team + mental health + team">Firstly, Amy had volunteered to the Mental Health Team, that she had previously purchased online a ‘micro dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms' to try and alleviate her systems.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The court heard that like ‘homeopathic medication' only a tiny amount of the active hallucinogen found in mushrooms would have been present, but that it was still illegal to possess this in the UK.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: mental health + mental health">The MDT decision was that because this was an illegal drug, because the MDT were unaware that micro dosing of hallucinogenic mushrooms was being used by mental health patients, and because they did not know how it would react with the Lorazepam, no Lorazepam was to be prescribed to Amy.</span> Secondly, Amy had previously disposed of medications prescribed to her which made her feel worse (a known side effect of some medications in the first few days of taking them). When advised to restart them, repeat prescriptions had to be made. In addition, just prior to her death Amy volunteered that she had been taking a sleeping tablet (Zopiclone) in the mornings, as well as taking them when she was supposed to at night. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Amy had said that her current PRN medication had no effect, but the Zopiclone did help.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: medication, prescription + higher">As a result, it was recorded by the MDT that Amy was ‘non-concordant' with her medication regime, therefore making her a higher risk of prescription misuse.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: medication, prescription + mental health + mental health">However, in her evidence, the Emergency Department Consultant said she was fully aware of the fact that micro dosing of hallucinogenic mushrooms was being used by mental health patients, and that due to the tiny amount of active hallucinogen it was generally not a barrier to the prescription of any other medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">In addition, the Emergency Department Consultant stated that if an individual had ingested a toxic quantity of hallucinogenic mushrooms, there was no contra-indication for the prescription of Lorazepam as it was often prescribed to reduce the hallucinogenic effects.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">In the evidence heard from members of the MDT, it was clear that the illegal use of a ‘micro dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms' coupled with Amy's non-concordance, led to the decision not to prescribe her Lorazepam.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: medication, prescription + mental health + treatment + mental health + lack of knowledge">As such, a lack of knowledge in relation to the common usage of micro dose hallucinogenic mushrooms as a self-treatment by mental health patients, a lack of knowledge in relation to there being no contra- indications for the prescription of Lorazepam if micro dose hallucinogenic mushrooms were being used, and defining Amy as ‘non-concordant' due to her use of Zopiclone when her PRN medication proved ineffective, prevented a realistic opportunity for the MDT to consider if Lorazepam should have been prescribed to Amy. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 21, 2025.</span> I, the Senior Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Amy's next of kin I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: (1) The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. (2) NHS England. (3) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 1 CORONER I am MICHAEL SPENCER, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of East Sussex. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicolette Elizabeth McCARTHY aged 46.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy died as a result of suicide due to her acute mental ill health and a series of contributory factors. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: safety + mental health + concerns">There were a series of failures in the systems and procedures which should have guaranteed her safety. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The jury made the following findings of fact in Box 3 of the Record of Inquest: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy was detained to the Woodlands secure unit - under the Mental Health Act - Section 5(2) for concerns of her own safety following attempts to take her life.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">On the 18th and 19th September there remained a risk that she may attempt to end her own life.</span> On 18th September 2023, Nicolette's family attended the ward round discussion, there is no evidence that confirmation of escorted or unescorted leave was delivered to them. Any ambiguity could have been avoided if Trust procedures had been followed, written confirmation of the S17 decision provided and acknowledged by the family. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk assessment, risk, assessment">It was appropriate to grant in principle unescorted S17 leave but not implement it until written confirmation was provided to the family and the risk assessment updated.</span> Nicolette should not have been required to leave unit grounds. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: policy + facilities">Although the NHS/Sussex Trust have a policy that no smoking should take place within the grounds, there should have been provisions that within secure units secure smoking facilities or indeed an exemption should have been made.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">As per the Trust's "Record of Patient leave" form, checks and consideration should have been given to the appropriateness of any items Nicolette had on her person for the leave being taken.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: immediate action + risk">As per the Trust's concession, the Trust did not take immediate action, aligned to Nicolette's individual clinical risk, when Nicolette did not return to the ward, following her 15 minutes leave (starting at 14:37) on 19 September 2023.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: gaps">The failure to mark Nicolette as AWOL rather than on leave added to the confusion and highlighted gaps in the record keeping.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Management of Staff and Staffing Levels
Keywords: staffing levels + staff + staff + availability">Although staffing levels were low and incidents on 19th September 2023 further impacted staff availability, there was a failure to take steps as outlined in Trust policies following identification of Nicolette's absence.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + patient">There were further factors in play: 1) insufficient adherence to recording patient login time in the procedure on the S17 leave sheet. 2) unacceptable delays in taking appropriate action on 19th September. 3) the Trust's adherence to robust note keeping/updating appears to have been lax and retrospective at times.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: mental health + risk + staff + staff + policy">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from clinicians and staff at the Trust to the effect that the NHS England smoke free policy is placing mental health in patients at an increased risk from self-harm and suicide.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: mental health + treatment">Although smoking cessation advice and treatment (e.g. gum, vapes etc.) are routinely offered to patients, the evidence was that many struggle to give up smoking on their admission to the ward, in part because the anxiety associated with stopping exacerbates their mental health symptoms.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Staff also felt that forcing patients to stop smoking against their will (e.g. by prohibiting them from smoking while on leave) would have a negative effect on their sense of autonomy and wellbeing, which are important for recovery.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy">The Trust understand that they are bound by the Health Act 2006 and by NHS England policy not to permit or facilitate smoking on the ward or anywhere on the grounds of the hospital.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: seriously + staff + staff">This is taken seriously and is interpreted to mean that staff are prohibited from facilitating smoking, for example by granting leave for the purpose of smoking or by escorting patients to smoke outside on short periods of leave.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: staff + staff + policy">Senior staff also believed that it would be contrary to NHS policy to permit smoking in a secure area, for example the enclosed ward garden.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: mental health + time">At the same time, it was acknowledged that patients would inevitably seek leave to smoke and that this could not be denied without a negative impact on their mental health.</span> The jury heard evidence that patients, like Mrs McCarthy, were routinely given 15- minute grounds leave for the purpose of smoking, a practice that is discouraged by the Trust. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: higher + risk + between, staff + between, staff, patient + policy">Clinical staff felt that the policy placed them in a difficult position, torn between the need to comply with the smoke free policy, while also supporting patient autonomy and keeping safe those patients who are at a higher risk of self- harm or suicide.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy">There is a further contradiction caused by the smoke free policy, in that patients are not permitted to smoke on the grounds, but are not supposed to leave the grounds during short periods of ‘grounds' leave.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: poorly + staff + staff">The result is that patients would spend their 15-minute leave smoking by the side of the road on the edge of the ward grounds, which is a poorly supervised area, and staff would avoid asking them too closely where they were going and would avoid standing close to them, even when smoking themselves.</span> This contributed to the circumstances that allowed Mrs McCarthy to slip away unnoticed and ultimately to take her own life. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: guidance + staff + staff + national, guidance + policy">I also heard evidence from senior staff that the national policy guidance intended to address smoking and s17 leave (e.g. the NICE Guidance and CQC Guidance) does not adequately resolve these contradictions.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: safety + mental health + policy">I am concerned that the NHS smoke free policy, while clearly motivated by a genuine and pressing concern to protect life and promote health, may not be adequately tailored to reflect the safety requirements of mental health wards or the reality that some mental health patients will inevitably seek short periods of leave to smoke.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: mental health + guidance + risk + national, guidance + policy">Action may need to be taken at the national policy level to provide clearer guidance and/or review the law to reduce the risk of patients in mental health wards absconding while on unescorted grounds leave. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 January 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: mental health + treatment + clear + patient + patient + mental health">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The inquest heard clear evidence of regular refusals of necessary and appropriate medical treatment by patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, over several years with insufficient consideration of steps that were then appropriate including a lack of steps to persuade the patient, insufficient consideration of the powers under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and insufficient consideration of utilising s.63 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (2) Insufficient action was taken when patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 routinely declined food over a prolonged period. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Tuesday 14 January 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

                        <td>The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The inquest heard clear evidence of regular refusals of necessary and appropriate medical treatment by patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, over several years with insufficient consideration of steps that were then appropriate including a lack of steps to persuade the patient, insufficient consideration of the powers under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and insufficient consideration of utilising s.63 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (2) Insufficient action was taken when patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 routinely declined food over a prolonged period. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Tuesday 14 January 2025.</td>

Although initially upset at the commencement of the meeting, Erin was observed to be smiling and cheerful when leaving the meeting. She had agreed to return to school the following day. During the evening of the 13 th July Erin was observed at home to be happy and preparing to attend school the next day. On 14 th July 2023 Erin was seen by her family during the early morning and showed no signs of being distressed or upset. During telephone calls with her father mid-morning, Erin stated that she would not be attending school and refused, despite attempts to persuade her otherwise by her father, to change her mind. Around 1030am her father became concerned that Erin had stopped responding to text messages or answering her phone and returned home to find Erin suspended by a ligature in her room. Emergency services attended and despite attempts at resuscitation Erin was pronounced deceased at the scene. Police enquiries revealed no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement in the death. Erin Louise TILLSLEY took her own life. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are recorded in the Narrative Conclusion. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Evidence was also received in the form of a Joint Policy Document published by Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (SNEE) and Suffolk County Council (SCC) (Version 21 - January 2023) titled ‘Suffolk and North East Essex Health & Social Care Protocol for the Support of Children and Young People in Crisis.'

Keywords: treatment + staff + staff">Following admission to Sapphire Ward, a decision was made by the consultant along with other hospital staff to introduce Olanzapine to Yemisi's treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering
Keywords: inadequate + administering">Yemisi was administered Olanzapine orally for 3-4 days, falling below the recommended trial period advised before moving to administering by depot injection and was therefore inadequate.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: decisions">As Olanzapine is a non-formulary drug for the Trust, additional requirements are in place to support prescribing decisions.</span> The justification relied upon by the consultant and lead pharmacist for prescribing the drug was unsuitable as the drug does not meet the criteria outlined in Section 62 of the Mental Health Act of being a) life-saving, or b) reversible. In addition, the requirement to seek a second opinion from an independent doctor in certain circumstances when changing medications was not fulfilled as the first depot injection was administered to Yemisi before approval was received from the SOAD. Owing to Yemisi's known and documented history of refusing vital signs checks requiring participation, the prescribing decision took into account the expected difficulties with conducting these checks. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: policy">However, there was no robust contingency plan for ensuring these checks took place, the plan itself was insufficient to accommodate Yemisi's circumstances and went no further than what is mandated in the Olanzapine policy.</span> Yemisi received a first Olanzapine depot injection on the 13 th of November, where she also did not comply with vital signs checks requiring participation. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: policy">Yemisi's non-compliance with vital signs checks requiring participation led to the decision being made that both depot injections would be administered relying solely on assessing Respiratory Rate and Level of Consciousness, departing from the Trust's Olanzapine depot policy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: staff + staff + policy + training">On the 13 th of December 2023, the plan in place was for one of the nurses on Sapphire Ward that day who had completed the Olanzapine training to both prepare and administer the injection, and as per the Olanzapine policy conduct the first set of vital signs checks, and be available for the duration of the 3 hour observations unless this responsibility is delegated to an appropriately qualified member of staff.</span> However this is not what transpired on the day. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

This nurse and the preparing nurse initially went to Yemisi's room to conduct pre- injection vital signs checks but those requiring participation were refused. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering

Keywords: concerns">Yemisi died on the 13 th December 2023 as a result of the toxic effects of the Olanzapine injection administered to her that day and neglect contributed to her cause of death." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence was given that: (1) Olanzapine Depot injections have a known risk of Post Injection Syndrome which can lead to death. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication, adverse reaction + administering + staff + staff, patient">Although the risk is rare, the Trust was aware of 2 other instances of Post Injection Syndrome following the administration of some 10 Olanzapine injections in the recent past, with both individuals surviving because of early intervention by medical staff. (2) The importance of timely observations is crucial to preventing Post Injection Syndrome and preventing death in the event of an adverse reaction to the drug. (3) In order to administer an Olanzapine depot, a prescribing doctor must seek approval from a Lead Pharmacist in the Trust because the medication is a "non-formulary" medicine. (4) The trial period for administering oral medication to a patient for whom it is proposed should have a depot injection is approximately 2 weeks, whereas Yemisi only took Olanzapine tablets for 3-4 days before having her first Olazapine depot injection.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Management of Staff and Staffing Levels
Keywords: medication + staff + staff, patient + busy">Therefore, she took her oral medical for less than the recommended period. (5) The requirement to obtain a second opinion from an independent doctor (SOAD) when changing medication did not happen when Yemisi was administered her first Olanzapine depot injection on 13 th November 2023. (6) In a busy psychiatric in-patient ward, staff can become distracted by having to tend to other patients, urgently, when events occur such as unexpected new patient admissions and disturbances. (7) Yemisi had a long history of refusing to take medication and refusing vital signs checks as a psychiatric in-patient.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">I am concerned that: (a) The risk of death from the use of Olanzapine depot injection needs to be made clear to patients who are going to be given that injection.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff, patient">Although it is very small risk, the fact that the risk can be largely eradicated by vital signs checks at intervals within the 3- hour period with early medical intervention, the risk needs to be stated to, and understood by, patients or those who represent their interests, before such a depot injection is given; (b) In a psychiatric in-patient setting, there are many demands on staff who can become distracted from their expected duties.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + staff + staff, patient">Unless there is a suitably qualified medical member of staff whose sole duty it is to remain in the company of a patient, who has had an Olanzapine depot injection at all times during the 3 hour post- injection observation period, there is a risk that vital signs checks will be missed and that Post Injection Syndrome will not be detected early enough if it occurs; (c) There is a risk that approval from a Lead Pharmacist to initiate a non-formulary medicine such as an Olanzapine depot can occur without the Pharmacist knowing whether a SOAD has been obtained in relation to that medication and that patient; (d) In cases where psychiatric in-patients are known to have a history of refusing vital signs checks, careful consideration and scrutiny should be given as to whether an Olanzapine depot injection is a suitable medication for such patients, especially in view of the crucial post-injection monitoring requirements. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 th January 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. HHJ Alexia Curran, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales· [REDACTED], the sister of Yemisi Cielto-Opaleye. I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

(2) The importance of timely observations is crucial to preventing Post Injection Syndrome and preventing death in the event of an adverse reaction to the drug. (3) In order to administer an Olanzapine depot, a prescribing doctor must seek approval from a Lead Pharmacist in the Trust because the medication is a "non-formulary" medicine. (4) The trial period for administering oral medication to a patient for whom it is proposed should have a depot injection is approximately 2 weeks, whereas Yemisi only took Olanzapine tablets for 3-4 days before having her first Olazapine depot injection.</td>

(6) In a busy psychiatric in-patient ward, staff can become distracted by having to tend to other patients, urgently, when events occur such as unexpected new patient admissions and disturbances.

Keywords: mental health + assessment + team">In the context of on-going suicidal ideation and a subjective mood score recorded as 0/10, he was appropriately referred to the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) for assessment by the A&E doctor.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: inadequate + assessment + patient">The assessment subsequently undertaken by the MHLT practitioner was inadequate and failed to appropriately act upon relevant information available to him including (but not limited to) information provided by Jamie's mother regarding her son's on-going suicidal ideation and her (and Jamie's) expressed request for him to be admitted to hospital as a voluntary in-patient as she, and Jamie, did not feel able to keep him safe.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">Although the MHLT clinician gave evidence that he had concluded that Jamie required and would benefit from a period of admission as an in-patient , no such admission was sought or planned.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: treatment + team">Instead, Jamie was discharged home with a plan for him to be seen the following day by the Home Treatment Team.</span> He was provided with a (daily) tablet of Zopiclone for the next seven days. Within hours Jamie had taken his own life having fallen a significant height from a window at his home address. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: clear + risk + patient">The failure by the MHLT practitioner to initiate the process for Jamie's admission to an in-patient bed constituted a clear missed opportunity to ensure appropriate and likely effective steps were taken to mitigate his high risk of acting upon his clear suicidal ideation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">The cumulative effect of the series of serious failures in the six months preceding the events of the 3 rd of June amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect

Keywords: medication + allocation + concerns + respect + care + care + risk + team">The lack of any adequate follow up led directly to a failure to conduct a full Multi-Disciplinary Team Meeting (MDT) in respect of Jamie's complex, on-going presentation involving increasing paranoia and psychotic-like symptomology in conjunction with on-going alcohol misuse; a failure to undertake an urgent medication review over the same six-month period despite repeated requests for the same from GPs, Jamie himself and his mother; the failure to hold a full MDT was a significant missed opportunity to allocate a Care Coordinator to Jamie and a missed opportunity to involve the Dual Diagnosis Service in Jamie's care; absent a full MDT and the allocation of a Care Coordinator, there was a serious missed opportunity to develop an appropriate Care Plan for Jamie and undertake regular, up-dated risk assessments regarding self-harm and suicide; On the 20 th May an EPUT Consultant Psychiatrist declined to undertake a review of Jamie's medication, or any further form of review as requested by Jamie's GP: this too was a serious missed opportunity. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors 
Keywords: access + training + training + training">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The accepted absence of effective formal, compulsory training for clinicians regarding the Dual Diagnosis (DD) pathway and what it does and does not provide, how to access it and the potential benefits of it.</span> The evidence confirmed that practitioners outside of the DD workers/pathway were unaware how they could contact them, including directly. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Verbal and Written Communication + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Management of Staff and Staffing Levels + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: communication + record + poor communication + poor communication + poor communication">In addition to weak record keeping and poor communication with patients and their families, the evidence revealed the lack of a robust and reliable system to ensure that the FRT deals with its caseload efficiently and effectively and particularly how it flags and then follows up referrals to and queries from other services/clinicians contributing, in turn and on the facts of this case, to the significant failure to hold an MDT.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The FRT did not follow up (as it was accepted it should have) the referral (via a self-referral) to Open Road or the referrals for a medication review.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: allocation + care + care + risk assessment, risk, assessment">Had there been such follow up, EPUT evidence confirmed that there would likely have been a discussion of Jamie's case at a full MDT with the likely allocation of a Care Coordinator, the likely involvement of the Dual Diagnosis pathway and the likely use of the RAG rating system to ensure on-going risk assessment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: clear + risk">In my opinion these features give rise to a clear risk of future deaths and must be addressed. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 23 rd December 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The family of the deceased, via their instructed lawyers at Leigh Day Solicitors.

Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Officer of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust 1 CORONER : I am Linda Lee, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS : I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulation 28 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST : On 14 July 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Darren Joseph Hope, who died on the 3July 2023 aged 53.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest before me and a jury on 24 October 2024. The conclusion of the Jury was: Medical cause of death: 1a Multiple Injuries Darren Joseph Hope died as a result of suicide. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation

Keywords: mental health + patient">Due to an administrative error, he was initially treated as a voluntary patient for several days before being formally detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act.</span> He had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Darren was deemed suitable for unescorted Section 17 leave, against a history of absconding, using alcohol and cannabis while on unescorted leave, and expressing suicidal thoughts while on unescorted leave at home. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">It does not appear that the Responsible Clinician was given this information.</span> Darren was granted six hours of unescorted leave. However, the Section 17 leave form signed by the Responsible Clinician indicated that he was to be accompanied by family members. The Responsible Clinician later reported this was an error, as he had intended to grant unescorted leave. The Responsible Clinician also stated that even if all of the events had been drawn to his attention, he would still have granted unescorted leave. On the morning of 3 July 2023, Darren appeared happy and optimistic about the future when he utilised his six-hour unescorted leave at approximately 11:15 am. He returned to his home address at around 2:15 pm. Darren lived in a 10th-floor flat. At approximately 3:20 pm, he was found at the base of the building and was pronounced dead. The cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries due to a fall from height. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

The evidence suggests that Darren had no means of contacting the Centre or anyone else if he had concerns, nor could the Centre contact him during his leave. His inability to contact or be contacted was not considered when granting his leave or when signing him out of the ward on 3 July 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

The Report noted that on 3 July 2023 Darren had been granted over the six hours permitted, as he left at 10:15 am [sic] and was not required to return until 6 pm.</span> The Report also noted that on 3 June 2023, Section 17 leave would have been permitted even though there was no Section 17 leave form in place on that date. Leave did not take place due to misplaced keys. The Report did not note that the Section 17 leave form in place on 3 July 2023 only permitted unescorted leave. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

No service had reported Mr Crane missing at this stage. At approximately 16:40 on 16 January 2024, Mr Crane approached two MPS officers on The Strand and asked them if he was a missing person. The officers undertook some checks and advised Mr Crane that he was not a missing person. Mr Crane went with the officers to Charing Cross police station.

CCTV footage showed that having left Charing Cross police station at about 17:30, Mr Crane spent about 35 minutes in the general vicinity. His whereabouts thereafter are not known. At approximately midday on 18 January 2024, officers from MPS Marine Policing Unit retrieved a body from the river Thames, near Free Trade Wharf. The body was identified as being that of Michael Crane, who was still wearing the wristband from his brief admission to the Hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: mental health + guidance + time + staff + guidance">The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows: 1) The MPS constable who gave evidence at the inquest, told me that: a) if Mr Crane had been reported missing at the time he was in Charing Cross police station then there would have been more that officers could have done to keep him safe; b) the fact that officers had heard (directly from staff) that the Home intended to report Mr Crane missing within the next 30 minutes, did not mean that there was more that the officers could have done at the time; and c) there was not, either at that time or to date, any MPS guidance to frontline officers in relation to how to approach their powers under section 136 of the Mental Health Act or in relation to people who are likely to be missing but have not yet been reported as such. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of the report, namely 6 December 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following: [REDACTED - brother of the deceased ([REDACTED]) Prime Life Limited Caernarvon House 121 Knighton Church Road Leicester Leicestershire LE2 3JN ([REDACTED]) I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Governor, HMP Ranby 1 CORONER I am Michael WALL, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST Mark Stephen Beresford aged 39 died by hypoxic brain injury due to hanging on 7 July 2023.</span> On 19 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death. An inquest was opened and later resumed before a jury on 7 October 2023, concluding on 15 October 2023. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH Mark Stephen Beresford died on the 7 July 2023 at Bassetlaw District General Hospital from hypoxic brain damage due to hanging. Mark was remanded at HMP Nottingham on 24 February 2023. He was later sentenced and was due for release on 25 August 2024. He transferred to HMP Ranby on 11 April 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

(Admitted by the Healthcare Trust) ii) A failure by healthcare staff at HMP Ranby to adequately assess the nature and extent of Mark's mental health problems between 11 April 2023 and 3 July 2023. (Admitted by the Healthcare Trust) iii) When Mark's ACCT was reopened on 2 July 2023, the decision by prison staff to set the observation levels at no more than 1 every 2 hours was unreasonable in all the circumstances. iv) Following a second self-harm incident on the 2 July 2023, there was an unreasonable failure to increase the level of observations. v) The assessment of Mark's risk and the decision by healthcare and prison staff to close the ACCT at approximately 9:50am on the 3 July 2023 was unreasonable in all the circumstances. (Admitted by the Healthcare Trust) vi) When the ACCT was reopened again at around 12pm that day, the assessment of his risk by prison staff and the decision to leave the observation levels at no more than 1 every 2 hours was unreasonable in all the circumstances. vii) A failure by prison staff to complete an immediate action plan within the required 1 hour or at all. (Admitted by prison authorities) viii) A failure by prison staff to respond to the cell bell that Mark activated at approximately 12:53 on 3 July 2023 in a prompt manner, which went unheeded for approximately 33 minutes until Mark was discovered unresponsive at 13:26. (Admitted by prison authorities) ix) A failure by prison management to ensure there were sufficient staff on duty on House Block 3 to respond to cell bells over the lunch period. (Admitted by prison authorities) 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the inquest I heard evidence of matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">I heard evidence that the prison authorities have already taken important steps, which I am satisfied address many of the concerns arising from Mark's death.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">I am concerned however, that despite very strong evidence to the contrary, they maintained the risk assessments conducted on 2 and 3 July were reasonable in all the circumstances.</span> The supervising officer involved in the decision to close Mark's ACCT on the morning of 3 July 2023, gave evidence that there was no likelihood Mark would commit further ACCTs of self-harm. While the inexperienced officer who later reopened the ACCT set Mark's observations at one no more than two hours apart, relying in part on the fact that that is what they had been set at when the ACCT had been reopened the previous day. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">However, there had since been two significant risk incidents and the officer did not consult a supervising officer as required by PSI 64/2011.</span> It is difficult to understand the prison's position that these assessments were reasonable in all the circumstances. Furthermore, on two occasions, the Head of Operations gave evidence that was incorrect and liable to mislead the jury and/or the coroner. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">He gave evidence confirming the requirement for a person raising a concern under the ACCT process to consult with a supervising officer in respect of observation levels.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Policies and Procedures
Keywords: clear + policy + policy">He then added: " I firmly believe that the supervising officers who gave evidence earlier this week, whether they recall it or not, would naturally have had that conversation, out of being inquisitive, that would be my own personal view point but in terms of the prison stance, that's what the policy says. " When it was pointed out to him that that was not supported by either of the witnesses involved - who were both very clear that there had been no consultation - he apologised and suggested he had misunderstood.</span> I am troubled by the fact that the Head of Operations, instead of reflecting on the significance of that evidence in terms of learning lessons from Mark's death, suggested to the jury that these witnesses must have been mistaken. The second occasion concerned the issue of cell bell cover on the day of the event that caused Mark's death. Mark was housed on HB3 North. The Head of Operations gave evidence that it is normal for both HB3 North and HB3 South to have a single officer detailed to deal with cell bells over the lunch period. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">The officer on duty on 3 July was however very clear in his evidence that he was detailed to cover HB3S only.</span> Every other prison witness asked about this agreed that there should be an officer covering each side of HB3 over lunch. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: team + team">Curious and concerned as to how a member of the prison's leadership team could have made such an error, I later recalled and asked the Head of Operations for an explanation.</span> He could provide none. Although, he did later apologise for his difficulty answering other questions asked of him, explaining that he does not usually work in safer custody. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: risk + team + team">That, notwithstanding steps since taken to improve work around ACCT processes and risk assessments, there remains an issue with understanding and assessing risk, which extends up to the leadership team at HMP Ranby. 2.</span> That there was a failure by the prison authorities to act with due reflection and candour during the inquest which, if unaddressed, will impede their ability to fully learn the lessons from deaths in custody. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 December 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following interested persons: Family - [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] Nottinghamshire Healthcare (NHS) Foundation Trust who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 25/10/2024 Michael WALL Assistant Coroner for Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Individual Staff Factors 
Keywords: mental health + training + training">The inquest heard evidence that the practitioner who saw Mr Swindells had very limited training in mental health and was employed in a role described as a mental health assistant practitioner.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">The evidence was that there was limited understanding of the scope of their role by GPs and what was covered by the term routine mental health appointments. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">In Mr Swindells case the evidence was that he should never have had a review undertaken by someone with such a limited an understanding of mental health and that lack of understanding of mental health meant that the practitioner did not recognise the level of risk Mr Swindells posed. 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
Keywords: team">The appointment had been booked via the reception team with no triage by a doctor following a telephone call to the practice.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

He died on the 31.12.22." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: mental health + care + assessment + record + referral">In the week leading up to the nurse's assessment: (a) A prison officer had made an urgent TAG mental health referral on 30.11.22, citing concerns that Oliver was experiencing active thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and that he (the officer) had "mild concerns" about intentional self-harm, and there were "definite indicators" of unintentional self-harm; and (b) Oliver himself had submitted a healthcare application form asking to see a doctor, saying that he was "extremely depressed", his anxiety was "really high" and he was "not coping at all, please help"; These important events were not highlighted on Oliver's SystmOne medical record, and so the nurse conducting the assessment 6.12.22 was not aware of either of these important recent events, and did not take them into account when assessing Oliver; 2) Oliver was allocated a care coordinator on 6.12.12 following the nurse's assessment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: mental health + care + record + referral">When conducting that RAG rating exercise, the care coordinator did not take into account: (a) The prison officer's urgent TAG mental health referral of 30.11.22 (above); and (b) A further TAG mental health referral made by a prison paramedic which cited "mild concerns" about both deliberate and unintentional self-harm on Oliver's part, the details of which had been entered onto Oliver's SystmOne medical record.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Keywords: mental health + access + communication + agency + information + geographical + communication + between + between, patient + trained">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - In relation to Policing is the extent to which all officers are trained to assess the increasing number of calls to the police which are of a mental health nature, the risks associated with the consequences of not making the right assessment where there may be an immediate risk to life and when to accept that the police are the right agency to be involved in mantal health related enquiries due to their powers of entry; In relation to the management of mental health patients that their carers are made aware of any admission under the Mental Health Act within 24 hours and those patients are supported with access to an independent mental health advocate; The apparent lack of connectivity between mental health services abroad and the UK upon repatriation whilst the patient remains ill; That there is a risk to patients generated by a decision to remove a patient from a GP practice list where the patient resides out of geographical area for that GP practice without considering the wider circumstances and the likely follow on care; and The means of communication is known and agreed between all mental health agencies to ensure all relevant patient information is held in an accessible central repository. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 th November 2024 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Constable of South Wales Police 1 CORONER I am David Regan, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of South Wales Central. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST A Coronial investigation was commenced on 27 th October 2020 into the death of Leighton Alan Dickens.</span> The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted with a jury on 18 th - 28 th September 2023. The conclusion was a narrative conclusion and the medical cause of death was 1 (a) pressure on the neck (incomplete or atypical hanging) 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH These were recorded as: - Leighton Dickens died by incomplete atypical hanging alone in his home address on 14th October 2020. The narrative conclusion which the Jury returned was: Leighton Dickens died by hanging himself in circumstances where his intention could not be ascertained. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + mental health">It is the juries understanding, that it was a missed opportunity on the part of the police not to detain Leighton Dickens at hospital until he had been assessed by a Mental Health Professional.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + concerns + mental health">The Inquest focused upon: - a) Mr Dickens' mental health condition and behaviour on the night of his death. b) The fact that police officers came upon him by the side of the road in an undressed state in the presence of his partner who was trying to convey him to hospital. c) His presentation and behaviour towards the officers before during and after arrival at hospital d) The decision by officers not to invoke their powers under s. 136 Mental Health Act and to leave Mr Dickens at hospital in circumstances in which they knew that he had not been subject to medical assessment and intended to leave. e) The limited sources of support available to assist or guide the officers. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + I-SIRch_Person - Staff (characteristics and performance)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to family who may find it useful or of interest.

Keywords: mental health + concerns + mental health">The effect of the discharge on the 31 st March 2023 was that Ms Petit was not admitted to a mental health hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and was therefore discharged without having been assessed comprehensively in a mental health hospital. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + treatment + review + mental health">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Evidence given by the court appointed expert consultant psychiatrist was that Ms Petit was not adequately medicalised and that she needed assessment and medical review with optimisation of treatment in a mental health hospital.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Her response to treatment needed to be observed.</span> This is what a s2 admission is designed to effect. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + treatment + optimal + mental health">The lack of a bed in a mental health hospital denied Ms Petit this opportunity for optimal treatment. (2) The Court heard that owing to a shortage of mental health beds patients who have been assessed by 2 s12 consultant psychiatrists to require detention after a mental health act assessment are being effectively detained in general hospitals without a section, awaiting a bed, because they cannot be placed under section unless a mental health bed is available. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 st November 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

In addition: Prior to being placed in the refuge on the 2 nd February 2023 Ms Kerr was charged with carrying a bladed article when she surrendered to bail. She told the police that she was carrying a knife for her own protection. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

She left the police station saying she was going to hospital. A SCARF was written but could not be lodged before the end of the working day on the 31 March 2023. As a result, it was not processed until Monday the 3 rd April 2023, after her death, because SCARF's are processed during working hours. The expert gave evidence was that she would have been very worried if she was told Ms Kerr was carrying a knife because she was having paranoid delusions that she needed to protect herself and her family. Some of Ms Kerr's paranoid delusions related to concerns about the actions refuge workers. The refuge was not contacted by the police on the 31 st March 2023. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

Keywords: mental health + information">However, I remain concerned about a number of matters: The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Cogent information about Ms Kerr's declining mental health was provided repeatedly to Surrey and Borders Partnership secondary mental health teams from the refuge support workers.</span> It was not explored with them, and insufficient weight was given to it during the triage process. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: mental health + treatment">Ms Kerr was not provided with appropriate and timely referrals for mental health treatment.</span> Despite the evidence that significant changes are being put in place the efficacy of these changes has not yet been evidenced. (2) Ms Kerr was seen at the police station and hospital in an extremely psychotic and paranoid state. Police records showed that she had been arrested and charged with carrying a bladed article. It was also recorded that she had subsequently carried a nail file, for her own protection. The officer who saw Ms Kerr on the 31 st March 2023 was unable to read the records because Ms Kerr's condition meant that the officer could not leave the interview room before Ms Kerr decided to leave the station. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: mental health + information + risk + between">No action was subsequently taken in relation to the risk. (3) The SCARF process does not enable information sharing between the Police, Mental Health Agencies and Surrey Adult Safeguarding out of hours.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

(4) The refuge was not made aware of Ms Kerr's presentation on the 31 st March 2023 by Surrey Police.</span> Her delusions about the actions of refuge workers could have put them in danger. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 th November 2024.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - During the course of the evidence from both family and medical witnesses it became clear that there were no adequate systems in place for providing crisis support to patients over the age of 65.</span> The family were very concerned and very frustrated by the futile attempts they made to secure psychiatric input and support when they could see a rapidly deteriorating picture. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">There was no explanation as to why individuals in crisis who were 65 or under had access to the crisis service but once a person is over 65 that service is no longer available to them.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: access + clear">It is not clear whether access to such services would have altered the outcome but the current structure and services available in my view denied Ms Guest with the opportunity of obtaining specialist assessment support at a much earlier stage.</span> A further concern was that the GP surgery provides patients with the crisis number seemingly without appreciating that this would only be available to those who were 65 or under. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors
