The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 th October 2024 and some key determinations were :- Medical Cause of Death : 1a. Multi Organ Failure 1b. Cardiogenic Shock 1c. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: pre-existing">Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy Conclusion: Died from complications following an acute deterioration having decompensated over a short period of time on a background of a previously undiagnosed pre-existing arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 1.</span> Christian had no known relevant past medical history. He was at school and had a passion for and love of boxing from a young age. He was a member of a boxing club. His father, who had served for 10 years as an infantry officer in the Army said that he had seen fit men, but Christian was amongst the fittest he had seen. 2. The Christmas period in 2017 had led to a large gathering at the family home in Northamptonshire. On Christmas day, Christian seemed fine before lunch and a photograph had been taken. He was said to have been in good form over lunch but went inside as he was not feeling well. It was not considered that he had anything other than a suspicion of flu. 3. When checked the following day, he seemed much the same at circa 12 noon and he was adamant he still wanted to go on holiday. He had taken paracetamol and Ibuprofen. He was checked again in the late afternoon and his mother then asked his grandfather (a retired Consultant) to look at him because of some concerning features. His grandfather found his conscious level to be ‘tenuous'. He considered him to be clammy and shut down. The radial pulse was not palpable and the carotid pulse was circa 240. He considered Christian was morbidly white and had no capillary return. 4. As a result, Christian's parents urgently transported him by car to the City Hospital, Peterborough. Christian told his mother on the journey that his heart had been going fast since after lunch the previous day and had a sound of rushing blood in his ears like he had been on a long run. 5. His grandfather telephoned the hospital and spoke to a receptionist and pre- warned about his arrival and relayed concerns about the heart rate, the poor perfusion and ‘the prejudiced cardiac output'. ADMISSION TO PETERBOROUGH CITY HOSPITAL 26/12/2017 6. Christian was documented as having arrived in the Emergency Department (ED) at 17:42. 7. Christian was seen by the assessment nurse on recorded entries at circa 17:45 where the presenting complaint was documented as?AF/?SVT. It was also documented that Christian had complained of chest tightness and vomiting and that he had already taken paracetamol and ibuprofen. 8. Observations documented a heart rate of 159 (with a recorded entry of 240 also), a blood pressure of 91/71 respiratory rate 17, SpO2 100% and Glasgow Coma Score 15. It was documented that Christian ‘looks pale'. Christian was triaged using the Manchester Triage System as category 2. 9. A plan was made for ongoing observations, an ECG, bloods and IV fluids. Only the observations and ECG were ticked as having been done. 10. Christian was moved into the resuscitation area of the ED, together with his parents. He was in a wheelchair. 11. The first set of observations were documented at 18:00. These recorded a respiratory rate of 25, SpO2 97 on air, temperature 35.9C, blood pressure 79/46, Alert on the AVPU scale. 12. The NEWS score was 10. 13. It was documented that the observations should be continued at 30-minute intervals. 14. The first ECG was done at 18:07. 15. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

The history included: · Unwell since yesterday morning · Felt palpitations while having lunch · In the night developed cough, productive of white phlegm · Had raised temperature and took paracetamol and ibuprofen · Body ache and three episodes of vomiting · Chest tightness but no pain · SOB at times 18. It was also documented that there was no nasal discharge or blockage, no sore throat, no rashes or neck pain, no abdominal pain, and no sudden change in bowel habit. 19. Those observations were recorded as per the observations done at 18:00. In addition, Christian was documented as being dehydrated ++. The pulse was documented as regular with normal heart sounds and the chest was clear with no increase in respiratory effort. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. Christian was not delirious, the GCS was 15, and neurological examination was normal. 20. The working diagnosis was noted as ? sepsis ?chest infection ?viral. 21. The management plan was: · ECG (this was done at 18:07 - described as sinus tachycardia). · Bloods - VBG, cultures · CXR · Urinalysis (a dipstick of the urine to look for signs of infection etc). · IV fluids · Antibiotics · TCI (meaning to come in) under medics if required. 22. The assessment was noted as completed at 18:35. 23. An x-ray was undertaken at circa 18:55 24.

Intravenous fluids were commenced but these were not given as rapid boluses and targeted against response - Christian remained hypotensive and tachycardic despite the fluid administration. 82. Apart from the blood cultures, bloods were not taken until 19:44. 83. I found that that the urgency of the situation was under-appreciated by the treating team. An expert indicated that it is very well recognised that unwell, and normally fit, children/young adults often look quite well until the point at which they rapidly decompensate. In the experts opinion, the fact that Christian was sitting up and talking resulted in a false sense of security and an under-appreciation of the physiological abnormalities on the part of some of those involved. 84. The expert also opined that there was a clear delay in getting the first blood gas. A cannula was in situ by circa 19:00, when intravenous fluids and antibiotics were given, and a venous blood gas should have been taken from this. This would likely have shown a raised lactate and potassium (as the ABG did at 19:44) - both of which would have impacted on management and should have further highlighted the severity of the situation. 85. I found that if there was difficulty in getting bloods, then this needed to be resolved by deployment of appropriate measures to expedite this. 86. Earlier correction of the high potassium, if it had been measured and recognised, may possibly have reduced the chance of further arrythmias. 87. Cyclizine was given as an antiemetic at circa 19:20. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

NWAFT ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB (CPICB) Intravenous fluids were commenced but these were not targeted against response. Christian remained hypotensive and tachycardic despite the fluid administration. This is an area of concern also. Another example of this is seen in a coronial investigation into the death of LM within the trust under reference 01976-2023. An independent expert flagged an issue on fluid management in that matter and the Trust SI report also found that the effects of Hartman's solution was not evaluated, and no further fluids were given. Additionally, adherence to policy on completion of fluid balance charts and the understanding and need for acting on flags is a matter of concern. It is not clear if the trust and CPICB has identified this as a recurring theme in audits/deep dive reviews. POINT D -TEAM INTERACTIONS To: i. NWAFT A concern arises over communications within a team itself and also interactions with other teams - e.g. when a referral is made to the medical team. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: care">An example is the entry ... ‘TCI medics, if required' ... and so there was no expression of the need for urgent review by the medical team by the key clinician involved in ED care.</span> The cases of CR under case ref :03638-2019 and SO under case ref: 00133-2023 are further examples on issues of team interactions. A final example is seen again in the death of LM (see ref earlier). The SI of the trust found that case management and plans should be carried out in a timely manner, (particularly administration of antibiotics, blood test requests and specialty team assessment following referral from the ED). It was found that the deceased had not been seen by the medical team after referral to them and before a cardiac arrest. POINT E - RADIOLOGY WITHIN NWAFT TO: i. NWAFT Another recurring theme is radiology within the trust. In the case of Christian, nothing is recorded in the notes on assessment of the X-Rays undertaken. There have also been a number of instances in our coroner investigations where there is an issue surrounding radiology. POINT F -RADIOLOGY NATIONALLY TO: i. The Royal College of Radiology ii. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care">Department of Health and Social Care I have a concern over whether there are sufficient numbers of radiologists to cover the ever-increasing expansion of imaging as a key diagnostic tool.</span> Further, there seems an almost two-tier system - that available in Tertiary hospitals and that available in district general hospitals. POINT G - BLOOD GASES/ ELEVATED LACTATE TO: i. NWAFT There was a delay in getting the first blood gas. A cannula was in situ by circa 19:00, when intravenous fluids and antibiotics were given. A venous blood gas should have been taken from this. This would likely have shown a raised lactate and potassium (as the ABG did at 19:44) - both of which would have impacted on management and would have further highlighted the severity of the situation. The ABG at 19:44 was consistent with a compensated lactic acidosis and hyperkalaemia. In the case of CR (see earlier ref). A blood gas requested by an anaesthetist was not done. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care">A further example is seen in the coronial investigation into the death of SO (see earlier ref) where an expert concluded that lactate was not measured until 02:30 on 30.12.2022 and it was 5.1. mmol/L - recognition of its elevation would likely have prompted earlier senior review, CT imaging and review by critical care.</span> Again, in the death of LM (see earlier ref). An independent expert report has raised a number of issues on clinical management in that matter. Specifically, the lactate was 9.18 from a VBG timed at 05:10 on 28/7/23 and the trust itself in an SI report concluded that there was no escalation. The death of Christian and these further examples raise a concern. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

It was emphasised that with antiemetic prescriptions being a common practice, it is vital to educate about their side effects, such as prolongation on QT. Exercising future caution before using these medications will help mitigate the risk of such adverse events. While emergency departments are already so busy, routine ECGs could help prevent such disasters from happening. It is also essential to ensure that doctors are equipped with the necessary skills and experience for early recognition of such a phenomenon. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Chief Executive Officer, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Guy Davies, His Majesty's Assistant Coroner for Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 9 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of sixty-five-year-old June Thompson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 March 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: treatment + spread">June died from recognized complications of necessary medical treatment. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 1) June died after a short illness following diagnosis of a very aggressive form of cancer in the hip which spread to the lungs. 2) June first presented with symptoms associated with her cause of death in January 2023 and was initially treated at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (RCHT) where a cancerous hip tumour was identified. 3) The rapid growth of the tumour meant that her case had to be transferred to Oxford University Hospital (OUH) for specialist surgery which was not available at RCHT.</span> June required a hindquarter amputation, involving the removal of the whole leg and hip joint, the latter to include removal of the tumour from the hip. 4) This major surgery was originally proposed to June as being a curative operation. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: spread">A CT scan report conducted 26 July 2025 by RCHT indicated that the cancer had spread.</span> The scan report showed multiple new lung metastases. The cancer in the lungs was of such an extent that it was not operable or treatable. 6) June's clinical condition had now changed from being curative to palliative. 7) The 26 July RCHT CT scan report was sent to OUH and uploaded to the OUH digital file on 15 August 2025. The scan report was not directly emailed to the OUH surgeon. 8) The operation went ahead on the 23 August 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Bedford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] CEO Bedford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Emma WHITTING, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Bedfordshire and Luton Coroner Service 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline GREEN aged 72.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 01 April 2025. The Narrative Conclusion of the Inquest was: The Deceased suffered from acute on chronic kidney impairment and kidney infection but died from paracetamol induced liver failure whilst being treated in hospital 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH At around lunchtime on 29 August 2023, the Deceased was admitted by ambulance to Bedford Hospital, having been found on her bedroom floor. She had reported to her carer that she had been there since falling in her dining room and crawling to her bedroom two days previously. She was described by the attending paramedics as being very weak, very slim and frail. In the Accident and Emergency Department, it was noted she was cachectic and dehydrated but her liver function tests were normal. She was admitted to a ward later that evening. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: access + staff + staff">Her weight was not taken prior to nursing staff asking a night junior doctor (who had not seen her nor had access to her records) at around 23.37 hours, to prescribe her with paracetamol.</span> As the doctor was unaware that she weighed less than 50 kg, she was prescribed 1,000 mg of paracetamol to be taken 4 times daily. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Although nursing staff estimated her weight at 44 kg the following day, and her actual weight was confirmed to be 33.6kg sometime on 31 August 2023, she continued to receive the prescribed dose of paracetamol until the evening of 31 August 2023, when the last dose was withheld by nursing staff.</span> The reason for the withholding of the last dose of paracetamol on 31 August 2023 remained unclear. At around 11.20 hours on 1 September 2023, she suffered an episode of coffee ground vomiting. She continued to receive a further dose of paracetamol at 11.48 hours on 1 September 2023 but at the lower level of 500 mg. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">The reason for the reduced dose was also not clear.</span> Following receipt of blood test results at 13:28 hours on 1 September 2023, which showed a significant derangement in her liver function, the administration of paracetamol ceased, and she was treated for paracetamol induced liver injury. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: treatment + care">Despite treatment, her condition deteriorated and as she was not a candidate for a liver transplant or intensive care treatment, she was placed on end-of-life care.</span> She passed away at the hospital on 3 September 2023; her death being confirmed at 22.12 hours. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Post-mortem examination confirmed that, whilst her fall and initial admission were due to acute on chronic kidney impairment and kidney infection, her immediate cause of death was liver failure. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: safety + time + patient + national">Despite the fact that the HSSIB made Safety Observations to mitigate the risks of unintentional paracetamol overdose in adult inpatients with low bodyweight in their National Report dated 24.02.2022 ( https://www.hssib.org.uk/patient-safety-investigations/unintentional-overdse-of-paracetamol-in-adults-with-low-bodyweight/ ) none of these had been addressed/adopted at Bedford Hospital by the time of the Deceased's admission on 29 August 2023 which meant that, despite weighing only 33.6kg, the Deceased was prescribed a daily dose of 1,000 mg x 4 which was only suitable for a patient weighing in excess of 50kg. 2.</span> A lengthy PSII investigation (completed on 16 September 2024 and received by the Senior Coroner on 24 October 2024) delayed the hearing of the Inquest but also left unanswered questions. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: prescription + staff + staff">In particular, there was no explanation as to why the nursing staff, having estimated the Deceased's weight at 44 kg the day after the paracetamol was prescribed (which although quite incorrect was still below the threshold for a prescription of that level) still proceeded to administer the prescribed dose yet did not administer the last dose on the night of 31 August 2023 and administered only 1⁄2 the prescribed dose the following morning.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety, prescription + concerns + staff + staff">Further exploration of this with the relevant staff might well highlight additional safety concerns (for example, did nursing staff feel unable to challenge the prescription directly with the doctors?). 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: medication, safety, prescription + respect + information + staff + staff, patient + record">Despite the PSII report referencing the 2022 HSSIB report and recommending that this should be shared with staff, relevant Safety Observations made in the HSSIB Report appear to have been insufficiently addressed: (a) Although Bedford Hospitals NHS Trust are now using the Nervecentre electronic record system which, since 28th February 2024, has included the height and weight of patients and prevents a prescribing doctor from prescribing without a patient's weight having first been entered, staff are still able to enter a estimated weight and there do not appear to be any alerts on this system to advise of the need for weight accuracy in the prescription of oral paracetamol and consideration of the risk of liver toxicity in those weighing under 50 kg (as advised in Safety Observation 02/2022/151); (b) Whilst the PSII report states as an Action that " Patients should be weighed on admission and the information documented ", other than the provision of a ‘pat slide', no other practical actions are planned for actually achieving this outcome, particularly in respect of those adults at risk of an unintentional paracetamol overdose, such as an alert aimed at those administering medication as well as those prescribing it (as advised in Safety Observation 02/2022/151). 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 30, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . Northampton General Hospital 1 CORONER I am Elizabeth WHEELER, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Northamptonshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Linda Christine FARMER aged 67. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 2 April 2025 at Northamptonshire Coroner's Court. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The medical cause of death was: I(a) Bronchopneumonia (b) (c) (d) II Liver cirrhosis with hypoalbuminemia, COPD, poor nutritional status The Box 3 findings of the record of inquest were: Linda Farmer died at Northampton General Hospital on 22 August 2023.</span> She had been admitted on 19 August, very unwell, and was swiftly place on a palliative pathway. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: conditions">She died as a result of bronchopneumonia, her death being hastened by other underlying medical conditions and her poor nutritional state.</span> She had had a previous admission to the hospital from 27 June - 16 August. Throughout this admission, her albumin levels had been low, and were consistently falling. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: concerns + care + information + care + care">Additional information for the purpose of this report is that: When Mrs Farmer was re-admitted on 19 August, the clinicians caring for her identified concerns with the care provided in the admission from 27 June - 16 August, namely, in relation to the low albumin levels.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: concerns + time">These concerns were notified to the Family, and raised with the Medical Examiner at the time 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

Keywords: concerns + care + care + care + issues">The absence of such investigations, having been identified by Trust processes as having been recommended, means that the care concerns raised have not been investigated, and any underlying system issues contributing to these have not been identified or resolved.</span> This means they are at risk of occurring again, putting patients' lives at risk. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 30, 2025.

Keywords: patient">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 25 March 2025 at Exeter Coroner's Court, in the County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay Coroner Area. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mary Pomeroy was a frail 89 year old female who suffered fatal traumatic injuries that were inflicted upon her (following being pushed over and falling to the ground) by a fellow in-patient on their shared ward at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth in March 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + record">Section 2 of the Record of Inquest (which recorded the medical cause of Mary Pomeroy's death) was determined as: 1a - combined physiological effects of bilateral humeral fractures in an elderly patient 1b - traumatic fall to ground following being pushed over Section 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Mary Pomeroy came by her death) was determined as: ‘Mary Pomeroy was an in-patient at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth when, on 3 March 2022, she was pushed over on to the floor by a fellow patient who had been suffering with psychotic symptoms and cognitive and behavioural problems.</span> Mary suffered fractures as a result of this trauma. Mary's condition deteriorated after, and as a direct result of, this incident, and she died on 15 March 2022 at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: concerns + assessment + patient + record">There was a lack of assessment and management of the patient who pushed Mary over and this materially contributed to the incident occurring and therefore to Mary's death.' Section 4 of the Record of Inquest (which provided the conclusion as to Mary Pomeroy's death) was determined, in narrative form, as: ‘Mary Pomeroy died from injuries suffered following being pushed over by a fellow patient on the same ward in hospital - this fellow patient had psychiatric, behavioural and cognitive difficulties and wasn't being closely supervised on the ward.' 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Derriford Hospital in Plymouth is the main acute hospital site managed by UHP NHS. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: analysis + respect + patient">UHP NHS carried out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigation in respect of the circumstances which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient on a ward at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth and her death thereafter.</span> This investigation culminated in a written investigation report which was given executive sign off on 14 July 2022, by the SI panel chair and chief nurse of UHP NHS. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">The main body of the investigation report concluded that the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient was ‘a rare and devastating accident for which could not have been foreseen'.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: review + staff, patient">The summary of the SI Panel Meeting Review, chaired by the Chief Nurse on 4 July 2022, stated that ‘overall it was considered that [the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy] was managed appropriately during his admission to UHP NHS and concluded that this was a deeply unfortunate accident, but not one that could have been anticipated and therefore prevented by staff.' The inquest heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022 had done almost exactly the same thing to another patient on the ward only two days previously, on 1 March 2022 - this incident was discussed in the main body of the RCA investigation report, but not referred to at all in the SI Panel Meeting Review summary.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff, patient">The inquest also heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy had been involved in a number of incidents where he had used physical force on staff members on the ward in February 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + care + care + staff, patient">At the inquest, the author of UHP NHS's investigation report (who was the Matron of the relevant ward) accepted, in evidence, that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy should, on 3 March 2022, have been subject to enhanced observations of care - this was on the basis that previous assessments in November 2021 and January 2022 had shown that this was required for him owing to his psychiatric and behavioural presentation (which had become more concerning by the end of February/beginning of March 2022) and also because of very recent and specific concerns regarding his behaviour which should have been obvious to ward staff following the incident on 1 March 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + time + assessment + patient">The Matron accepted, in evidence, that had enhanced observation and care been in place for the patient (which could have taken a number of forms following assessment, depending on what would have been most clinically and therapeutically appropriate at the time) then he should have been prevented from being in a position where he was able to push Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022.</span> The Matron accepted, in evidence, that UHP NHS's RCA report had been incorrect to conclude that the type of incident that occurred on 3 March 2022 could not have been foreseen. The Deputy Chief Nurse of UHP NHS accepted, in evidence, that the SI Panel Meeting should have interrogated the relevant facts and chronology more. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + patient">The inquest determined that the incident on the ward on 3 March 2022 was foreseeable, based on the concerns about the patient's behaviour, the likely triggers for him becoming distressed and aggressive and the almost identical incident that had occurred on 1 March 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: needs + assessment + patient">The inquest also determined that the lack of assessment and management of this patient's behaviour and needs materially contributed to the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy suffering injuries and led to her death.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: analysis + care, clear + inadequate, care">It is unfortunately clear, when comparing the evidence heard at the inquest with the findings of UHP NHS's RCA report, that there was inadequate analysis of this serious incident by UHP NHS, with concerning circumstances surrounding the care provided not being identified - therefore appropriate recommendations to inform future care provision were not given consideration as part of the RCA investigation/report.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">If UHP NHS do not identify concerning matters when carrying out internal investigations and do not take steps to try and learn from serious incidents when they occur, then there is an obvious, significant and continuing risk of future deaths occurring arising out of healthcare provision provided. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action (for the reasons set out in paragraph 5, above). 7 YOUR RESPONSE Your organisation is under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 May 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend this period. If any request is to be made for this period to be extended, please ensure this is made in writing at least 14 days prior to the above required response date. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to Mary Pomeroy's sons and the Care Quality Commission.</span> I have also sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths Report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Medical Director Homerton University Hospital NHS Trust Homerton Row London E9 6SR 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 25 January 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of William Hewes aged 22 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: treatment">William's life threatening condition was recognised immediately he attended hospital, but he did not receive the necessary treatment as promptly as he should have done.</span> The cause of the delay was multi factorial. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: situation">I heard at inquest that the Homerton University Hospital NHS Trust has done a great deal of work since William's death to try to avoid this sort of situation arising in the future.</span> If future patients at the Homerton can benefit from William's death, then why not future patients elsewhere? It seems to me that there would be great merit in sharing the learning nationally. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26 May 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Deceased name: David Tighe
Coroners name: Michael Walsh
Coroners Area: Oxfordshire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Michael Walsh, HM Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Oxfordshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST The inquest into the death of Mr David Vincent Tighe, aged 59, was opened on 26 th April 2023. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 th December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The medical cause of death was: Ia Sepsis due to Bronchopneumonia Ib Enterocolitis with Paralytic Ileus Ic Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Oesophagus Treated with Chemotherapy II Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The Narrative conclusion to the inquest was: David died due to complications of treatment for chemotherapy-induced enterocolitis; contributed to by Neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH David was a 59-year-old man who had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction in November 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">With chemotherapy treatment his prognosis was at least a year, and he was being treated with the intention of prolonging his life.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">He subsequently suffered chemotherapy-induced enterocolitis, which was a known complication of his treatment, and related symptoms required his admission to Churchill hospital on 02.02.2023.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">During treatment in hospital, David suffered three instances of aspiration of bile into his lungs when he was laid flat, that should have been avoided.</span> The Ryles tube being used to drain bile from his stomach, and the amount of bile being drained, were insufficiently monitored, and the Ryles tube became displaced following an episode of vomiting, on 08.02.2023, causing ineffective and/or partial drainage over several hours. He was also noted to have bile in his mouth on the morning of 09.02.2023. There was no discrete policy in place for the management of Ryles tubes, and no repeat position check forms were used, although they were said to exist. Had displacement been recognised in a timely manner and/or had the presence of bile in David's mouth been escalated in a timely manner, all events of aspiration should have been avoided, by virtue of the Ryles tube being repositioned or replaced to provide effective drainage; and/or by virtue of advice being given not to lay David flat, or to do so with particular caution. Instead, no particular caution was taken when laying David flat and he suffered aspiration which contributed in a more than minimal way to bronchopneumonia and sepsis from which David died on 11.02.2023. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Concerns directed to Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust CONCERNS Absence of a Ryles tube policy: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: care + guidance + care + guidance">At the time of David's death there was no separate policy for Ryles tubes, and clinicians were required to apply the modest Royal Marsden Manual guidance, and/or note that the practice consideration and care requirements for Ryles tubes were not dissimilar to that for nasogastric tubes used for enteral administration, as per the Trust's " Insertion, Use and Care of Nasogastric Feeding Tubes in Adults: Policy and Procedure ", October 2018 (‘NG feeding tube policy'), which provided limited advice.</span> Evidence was given that a Ryles tube policy was required and that there was motivation at the Trust to provide one, albeit none has been forthcoming in the 20 months since David's death. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: staff + staff + record">Evidence was also given that an NG tube "Position Record" for recording "Repeat Position Checks" was in use for Ryles tubes (similar to the " Nasogastric Feeding Tubes Position Record - Repeat Position Checks " document at Appendix 11 / page 53 of 55 of the Trust's NG feeding tube policy), but several staff were unaware of such a document existing for Ryles tubes, and no such Ryles Tubes records were ever disclosed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Expert evidence was given that it was suboptimal care not to have a specific policy for the management of Ryles tubes given the risks associated with such an invasive procedure that required ongoing monitoring.</span> At the time of the inquest, the Trust's expressed intention was to provide a Ryles tube policy, and assistance was said to have been requested from the Shelford Group (an external body), although conversations about such a policy were said to have started within the Trust itself, as early as April or May of 2023. It is therefore unclear whether a Ryles tube policy would ever be produced notwithstanding one appears to be accepted as being required. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">The absence of policy where a need has been identified creates an obvious risk of death to future patients, due to the absence of guidance and procedure to assist clinicians undertaking such an invasive procedure.</span> Use of a narrowly focussed structured review by a treating clinician: 2. On 18.03.2023 the Trust undertook a Structured Review to consider learning from David's death. Evidence was given that the Structured Review was intended to be narrow in focus, as opposed to a more comprehensive serious incident report. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: information + areas + environment + staff + staff">As a result, it did not involve taking information from staff, but was a 2-hour review of the medical records across five different areas, undertaken in a highly pressured environment.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + record">The Structured Review consequently overlooked considering several issues including: (i) missing bile drainage entries; (ii) missing clinical observations contrary to Trust policy (" Recognising the Acutely Ill and Deteriorating Adult Patient (RAID) Policy , April 2021); (iii) the absence of Repeat Position Checks for the Ryles tube; (iv) the absence of any written record of family concerns that were raised with a ward sister.</span> Evidence was given by an author of the Structured Review that he considered its scope was in fact too limited, and in future, he would advise suspending such a narrow review. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">That author was also a clinician involved with David's care in spite of the potential for conflict being correctly raised with the Trust in advance.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Any inability to adequately investigate such incidents, without undue restriction in scope, without time pressure, and without any appearance of conflict or bias, creates a risk of death to future patients, as oversights or omissions in care, policy or procedure that may be missed by a narrow review, may remain unidentified and unremedied. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action in relation to the concerns above. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6 h March 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. David's family 2. Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 9 th January 2025 Michael Walsh HM Assistant Coroner Oxfordshire Coroner's Court

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you; the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. - At inquest it was heard in evidence Tom was suffering from a hiatus hernia, which is a common condition suffered by up to 60% of the population in middle and later life. In the majority of cases a hiatus hernia is asymptomatic, and an individual can be unaware of its presence. Evidence identified there are two types of hiatus hernia. A sliding hiatus hernia, which moves up and down through the naturally occurring hole in the diaphragm, and therefore in and out of the chest area, and; A para-oesophageal hiatus hernia (also called a rolling hiatus hernia) where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus and stays there. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">In the population over 80% of those individuals who suffer from this condition have a sliding hiatus hernia, whilst only between 5-15% will have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The difference between the two types of hiatus hernia is import, as the para-oesophageal hiatus hernia is far more likely to develop known complications, and therefore more likely to require surgery.</span> However, it was heard in evidence that in England many non-gastro specialist medical clinicians within the NHS are unaware of the difference in the two types of hiatus hernia, and are therefore unaware of the additional risk posed to the 5-15% of patients with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + between + between + guidance">It was heard in evidence that the NHS England online guidance makes no distinction between the two types of hiatus hernias, whereas the guidance for NHS Scotland does.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">As a result, the lack of understanding of the difference between the two types of hiatus hernia within the medical community means that there is no increased vigilance taken when individuals with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia present with symptoms.</span> In addition, the cohort of individuals who suffer from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia in England, are unaware of the increased risk posed by their condition and are therefore unable to advocate for more testing, or seek a second opinion, when worrying symptoms do arise. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken in order to prevent future deaths, and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take any such action you identify. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 12 th May 2025 I, the Senior Coroner, may extend the period if I consider it reasonable to do so.

[REDACTED] re-attended the Labour Ward on 9 November 2019 when due to a report of reduced foetal movements, she should have received obstetric care and additional monitoring during delivery.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Technologies - Interpretation (e.g., CTG)
Keywords: equipment + care + obstetric + ctg">During the course of the labour on 9 November 2019 there were multiple missed opportunities for enhanced care and obstetric input including a failure to act on bloodstained liquor, a rising foetal heart rate before 10 am, failing to act on clinical signs that made it inadvisable for [REDACTED] to enter the birthing pool, failure to act on a significant slowing of the baby's heart at 10:15 am, a lack of urgency both in asking [REDACTED] to leave the pool and on obtaining CTG monitoring equipment, failing to summon obstetric help at an appropriate time, the midwives becoming task focused on obtaining a foetal heart rate and deriving reassurance from unreliable heart rate readings that lead to avoidable delay.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: quality + obstetric">The obstetric delivery of Ida was of high quality but, due to the delay involving obstetricians, Ida was born pale in colour with a low heart rate and severe hypoxic ischaemic brain damage.</span> The initial resuscitation for 3 1⁄2 minutes led by the Labour Ward Coordinator was wholly ineffectual and Ida's condition at the time of arrival of the paediatric registrar was consistent with ineffective ventilation where chest rise could not be seen, the heart rate was less than 60 bpm and she was grey in colour. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: quality">The paediatric registrar took over the resuscitation, Ida responded quickly to ventilation and from this point onwards the resuscitation was of high quality.</span> The conclusion of the inquest is as follows: On 9 November 2019 [REDACTED], who was pregnant with Ida, attended the Royal Lancaster Infirmary Labour Ward in early labour. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care">Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress and contributed to by the lead midwife‘s wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation for Ida during the first 3 1/2 minutes of her life that further contributed to Ida's brain damage from which she died on 16 November 2019 at the Royal Preston Hospital neonatal intensive care unit.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: inadequate + review">The inquest was one in which Article 2 was fully engaged as a result of the Trust's clinical governance arrangements, inadequate investigations, a lack of transparency and openness, a failure to respond to a detailed complaint letter, a failure to comply with the Duty of Candour, disputing the findings of the Secretary of State for Health's independent review panel (HSIB now MNSI), failing to notify external monitoring bodies and failing to comply with internal protocols.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: respect + maternity, care + culture">The Trust's lack of compliance with clinical governance requirements in the investigation into Ida's death had significant similarities with the criticisms made in 2015 of the Trust as set out in The Report of the Morecambe Bay Investigation, otherwise known as the Kirkup Report. [REDACTED] who gave evidence at the inquest, expressed the view that there was a deep seated and endemic culture of defensiveness in respect of maternity incidents at the Trust. [REDACTED] also said that the investigation showed elements of failing to identify significant care issues, brevity, defensiveness and was conducted by unskilled investigators.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Keywords: culture">Urgent action is required by the Trust to meaningfully embed the Dury of Candour 2. [REDACTED]'s evidence to the inquest was that a deep-seated and endemic culture within the Trust leads to denial and a failure to learn. [REDACTED]'s Investigation report was published in 2015, the Trust is ten years on and still issues and themes identified in 2015 were very much in issue in 2019 and still exist at the Trust as identified by Ida's inquest. 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">The Trust's approach to the inquest has been one of a lack of transparency and openness, failure to provide relevant information and a failure to identify with candour the defective clinical governance processes that have operated at the Trust from 2019 to present day. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety + treatment + patient">The Trust did not disclose that they had failed to notify the external bodies namely the CQC and the then CCG [ICB] via STEIS and the Trust's internal Serious Incidents Reporting Investigation panel, none of which was noted by the Trust's Patient Safety Summits .The matter was reported to the Coroner a year after Ida's death by the family after the Trust took no action to do so, despite being on notice of failures in treatment from the HSIB report Ida's harm was at no point categorised by the Trust as a harm event that caused "death". 5.</span> Trust figures to the Board provided in 2025 stated that there were no complaints over 6 months old when the Trust at the time of the inquest have not responded to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]'s 1 June 2020 complaint. Together with the Trust's failure to categorise Ida's death as only "Moderate Harm" (see point 4 above) cause me also to have concern about the reliability of Trust's data. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Keywords: safety + maternity, care + review + patient">I consider the clinical governance arrangements at the Trust require urgent review to ensure the appropriate personnel are in place, with the necessary training and skills to deliver robust clinical governance to ensure patient safety in maternity care. 7.</span> As a result of the Trust's deficient processes, the Trust did not undertake any examination of its own clinical governance processes, which were a principle area of concern and which was identified to the Trust five months before the inquest commenced. The Trust's clinical governance arrangements were extracted piecemeal during the course of the inquest. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: information">The clinicians' reports to the inquest only answered the questions they were asked rather than trying to assist with a holistic view of the evidence, did not provide relevant information until it was extracted from the witness in testimony, that resulted in rolling disclosure of documents and additional witness evidence.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect

[REDACTED] in his evidence to the inquest said that the Trust focus on process, which means that you can comply with the process requirements and still produce an inadequate investigation, rather than focussing on outcome, which measures the quality of the investigation and the patient experience. [REDACTED] noted that the Trusts culture impeded transparent and open investigation.</span> I am told that the Trust now uses the PSIRF model and is to appoint 3 whole time equivalent Response Leads by 30 September 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect

The Band 5 midwife supporting [REDACTED] in Labour had not undertaken her required mandatory training and this fact had not been provided and was only revealed at the inquest as part of the evidence of the Head of Midwifery in March 2025. I was also concerned to learn that in 2025 non-completion of mandatory training was still an issue as [REDACTED] had not completed her mandatory training. 12. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions

This raises a significant concern that the Trust do not operate a system of remedial training when this inquest has identified remedial training was required for [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. D: Grading of harm for incident reporting: Babies who have sustained hypoxic brain injury and undergo cooling [Trust, ICB, DHSC, NHSE, [REDACTED]] 14. The Trust graded Ida's level of harm as "moderate", even after her death. This grading should have been adjusted to "severe" by the Trust before Ida was transferred to Royal Preston Hospital as the consultant paediatrician identified that she had sustained a severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy due to fetal bradycardia. 15. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

[REDACTED] confirmed that nationally there is inconsistency in categorisation of harm for babies who sustain a hypoxic injury due to fetal bradycardia in labour and who require cooling and clarification guidance would assist prevent further maternity deaths and ensure full and proper investigation of hypoxic injuries sustained in labour.</span> E: Funding for MSNI [DHSC and [REDACTED], NHSE and ICB] 17. But for the HSIB investigation report into Ida's death [REDACTED] admitted that Ida's death due to failures by the Trust would never have come to light or resulted in an inquest. 18. The MSNI is now hosted by the CQC with funding secured for the next two years but no certainty as to ongoing funding after this date. These independent investigations by specialist skilled investigators into the most serious of events is an essential safeguard to the lives of mothers and unborn children. 19. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

The conclusion of the inquest was: Alonzo Christopher Andrew Wood died on 26 September 2023 at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Eastern Road, Brighton, from multi organ failure which developed due to a significant hepatic congenital haemangioma identified in utero and that was monitored prior to birth. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: treatment + between">In the period between 21 September and his birth, a spontaneous bleed occurred which caused him to be critically unwell at delivery and despite treatment he sadly could not recover from the same.</span> The medical cause of Alonzo's death was recorded as: 1(a) Multi-Organ Failure And 2. Hepatic congenital haemangioma 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH At 28 weeks of gestation it was noted on scans that Alonzo had a mass on his liver. He was referred by the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton for specialist review by specialist from Kings College Hospital. A plan was made that Alonzo and his twin sister would be delivered at Kings College Hospital by caesarean section on 28 September 2023 due to Alonzo's liver condition. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: interpretation + interpretation, ctg">There were concerns about the interpretation of the CTG undertaken which resulted in Alonzo's delivery at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in the early hours of 23 September 2023.</span> There was no evidence that earlier delivery of Alonzo would have prevented his death in this case. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Technologies - Interpretation (e.g., CTG)

Keywords: guidance + guidance + ctg">In particular, the clinicians indicated that there was no guidance where there has been an abnormal CTG antenatally as to whether delivery should occur and, if so, in what period.</span> As such, the decision making is reliant on individual clinical judgment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13 May 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: CHIEF EXECUTIVE, NORTHUMBRIA HEALTHCARE NHS FOUNDATION TRUST 1 CORONER I am Mr Andrew Hetherington for Northumberland 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Renate MARK. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was died as a result of a head injury sustained in an unwitnessed fall. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had considerable underlying natural disease. Within her home address on 20 April 2024 she suffered an unwitnessed fall. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) The deceased was assessed as a level 3 falls risk meaning she was to be kept under line of sight in case of falling. Witness statements served in advance of the inquest stated the fall was witnessed. It was however eventually accepted in evidence that the fall was in fact unwitnessed. The precise circumstances of the fall could not be determined. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: policy + staff + staff">All of the investigations undertaken by the Trust relied upon the incorrect understanding that the fall was witnessed and observations were in line with Trust falls policy, when they were not. (2) The inquest heard that it is practice within the Trust that a Nursing Assistant is to be located centrally in the corridor on ward 9 to oversee patients assessed as at risk of falling and for the patients to be within staff's peripheral vision.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">The inquest heard that on 24 April 2024 8 patients were assessed as level 3 falls risk and 1 patient was assessed as level 4 falls risk.</span> I am concerned as to the number of patients at risk of falls being observed in this way. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">I am further concerned that there is a misunderstanding of what is meant by peripheral vision and what constitutes a witnessed or unwitnessed fall. (3) I am concerned there is not greater scrutiny of witness accounts as part of the Trust's investigation process in particular given the concerns raised by the deceased's family early in the investigation and the other witness accounts to provide earlier learning to prevent future events. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NORTHUMBRIA HEALTHCARE NHS FOUNDATION TRUST have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6 May 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons being the deceased's family. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

President Royal College of Emergency Medicine Octavia House 54 Ayres Street London SE1 1EU 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 September 2024 one of my assistant coroners, Edwin Buckett, commenced an investigation into the death of Billie Wicks aged 16 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 March 2025. I made a narrative determination having found that Billie died from infective exacerbation of asthma. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Billie had been brought to the Royal Free Hospital just before midnight the night before her death with an asthma attack. A first presentation of asthma at the age of 16 years without any family history is unusual, and it was a busy night in the accident and emergency department. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">Billie was inappropriately discharged at approximately 3.30am without adequate repeat observations or senior clinical review, and so her asthma was not diagnosed or treated.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">If it had been, she probably would have survived. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety + areas + patient">A PSII (patient safety incident investigation) was conducted and learning identified, but some areas of concern do remain.</span> The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. At inquest, I heard repeatedly that on the night Billie attended, the Royal Free emergency department was understaffed, and that it remains understaffed of doctors, nurses, and even a healthcare assistant who could take basic observations. Billie should have had observations every hour. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">If she had had these observations, the emergency registrar who discharged her would have recognised that she was not as well as he thought, and would have sought senior medical review.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">That senior medical review would have changed the course of her management and saved her life.</span> Following the inquest touching the death of Daniel Klosi, I wrote to you on 16 August 2024 about a lack of observations in the emergency department of the Royal Free. Although the circumstances were different, there is a theme. 2. The registrar who saw Billie the night before her death prescribed an antibiotic, but he was not in the habit of giving the first dose in the department and he did not on this occasion. This meant that Billie's infection was not tackled as quickly as it could have been. This seems to indicate a training and potentially a guideline need. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Cardiff & Vale University Health Board
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Cardiff & Vale University Health Board 1 CORONER I am Rachel Knight Assistant Coroner , for the coroner area of South Wales Central. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 24 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Colin Colley. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 th March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative: Colin Colley was aged 87 when on 14th October 2023 he died at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: comorbidities">Colin suffered with a number of comorbidities including dementia and frailty, and he was anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.</span> Colin suffered an unwitnessed fall from bed on 11th October, when he was an inpatient at St. David's Hospital, Cardiff. He was known to wander from his bed in hospital, and had fallen previously, and he had been assessed as being at high risk of falls. His restlessness and cognitive decline indicated that his cot sides should have been left down. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. NHS England, Wellington House 133-135 Waterloo Road, London, SE1 8UG. 2. University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Eastern Road, Brighton 1 CORONER I am Lisa Milner, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex, Brighton and Hove. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 30 January 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barry MYERS aged 59. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Barry Myers sadly died on the 28 January 2024 at Royal Sussex County Hospital, after suffering an ischaemic cerebral artery stroke. Unfortunately, a mechanical thrombectomy was not undertaken, as Barry had presented at the hospital outside of the hours, when the thrombectomy was able to be performed. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Barry Myers sadly died on the 28 January 2024 at Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, after suffering an ischaemic cerebral artery stroke. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

Deceased name: Allan Taylor
Coroners name: David Place
Coroners Area: Sunderland
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am David Place, His Majesty's Senior Coroner for the City of Sunderland 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 6 th February 2025 I commenced an Investigation into the death of Mr Allan Taylor, who died in Sunderland Royal Hospital on 1 st June 2024 aged 90 years. The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 5 th March 2025. I gave a narrative conclusion ‘Natural causes contributed to by the physiological strain of necessary surgical procedure to a fractured neck of femur following an unwitnessed fall in hospital.' The medical cause of death was: - Ia Myocardial Infarction Ib Hypertension Ic Chronic Kidney Disease II Frailty of Old Age, Fractured Neck of Femur (Operated) 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Allan was admitted on 28th May 2024 to Sunderland Royal Hospital following an unwitnessed fall at home with a long lie. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: concerns">Allan had been placed in a Side Room 1 due to concerns regarding possible clostridium difficile infection, which was later confirmed positive after tests.</span> Allan had been assessed by a physiotherapist on 29 th May 2024 that he needed minimal assistance to mobilise with the assistance of one person and a wheeled Zimmer frame. Allan had an unwitnessed fall on 29th May 2024 at 23:20hrs, with the evidence suggesting that he had moved to the end of his bed to negotiate the bed rails and then walked unaided for approximately 5 metres before falling, resulting in a fractured right neck of femur, which required necessary surgical intervention, as immobility posed a significant risk to him. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Following an uneventful induction of anaesthesia on 1 st June 2024, Allan became hypotensive on the operating table and went into a cardiac arrest. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Allan passed away whilst in theatre due to the physiological strain of the surgery. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - 1. The evidence confirmed that the guidelines for Level 2 EICO observations, which required a nurse to be within sight or sound of Allan, were not complied with as Allan was in a Side Room 1, which was not within sight or sound of the nursing station. It has been explained that the geography of that ward is such that this is the furthest side room away from the nursing station, and a vestibule is before it. 2. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The evidence was that this was not escalated to the Matron or Site Manager, which may have resulted in the movement of an additional member of staff to ensure compliance with the EICO Level 2 observations. 3.</span> The evidence was that had Allan been within sight or sound for observations, it was likely that upon Allan attempting to get out of bed, assistance could have been provided to him, which in turn may have prevented the fall. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

This report is being sent to: Royal Devon University Healthcare Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT DATED 28 NOVEMBER 2024 IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive - Royal Devon University Healthcare Foundation Trust. Family of Mr Raymond Albert Alfred Reid. Chief Coroner. 1 CORONER I am Philip SPINNEY, HM Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of The County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 9 March 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Raymond Albert Alfred Reid. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 27 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: Raymond Albert Alfred Reid died due to sepsis caused by recurrent urinary tract infection, pressure sores and pneumonia on a background of severe frailty. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 6 January 2023 Raymond Albert Alfred Reid was admitted to North Devon District Hospital with a catheter related urinary tract infection. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + gaps + care">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) Mr Reid died as a consequence of sepsis caused by a combination of a urinary tract infection (UTI), pressure sores and pneumonia; it was established during the evidence that it would not be possible to determine to what extent the infection resulting from the UTI, the pressure sores and the pneumonia individually contributed to the cause of death. (2) The pressure sores developed in hospital and the deterioration of the pressure sores was possibly caused by gaps in care and knowledge.</span> More particularly the evidence at the inquest (and the findings of an internal concise investigation) revealed that: a. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor

(1) Consideration should be given to reviewing the process of Managing and treating pressure ulcers in hospital and where necessary to provide training and education in Trust policies and best practice to staff across the entire Trust.</span> In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4th December 2024 I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: NHS England | Royal Stoke University Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> NHS England; and 2. Royal Stoke University Hospital. 1 CORONER I am Emma Serrano, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Staffordshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 9 January 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Christopher Glanville Bradbury. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a short form conclusion of complications following a fall. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between">The cause of death was: 1a Severe multi-organ failure 1b Severe septic shock 1c Severe Invasive soft tissue infection 1d Fall II Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH i) On the 28 December 2023 Christopher Granville Bradbury fell at his home address and sustained a cut between his two small toes on the right foot. ii) He was admitted to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, on the 2 January 2024.</span> He had symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting, and it was reported that he had collapsed. He has a lesion on his little toe on his right foot and swelling to his right leg. On examination he was placed on the SEPSIS 6 pathway, and treated in accordance with this. He was examined by an Orthopaedic registrar who ordered an urgent MRI scan, to ascertain the cause of the swelling and the lesion. iii) On the 4 January 2024, with no MRI scan being done, he received a Consultant review and a diagnosis of Invasive Soft Tissue Infection was made. He was too ill for a MRI scan and was taken directly to theatre for a below the knee amputation. iv) After the surgery, he did not recover an passed away on the 5 January 2024. There was an opportunity for Mr Bradbury to be given a MRI scan, and if this had taken place, he would have been diagnosed earlier, and received the operative intervention at an earlier stage. It cannot be said that this would have made a difference to the outcome for Mr Bradbury. v) It was accepted in evidence that the issue giving rise to the delay in the MRI scan was down to a lack of knowledge of Severe Invasive Soft Tissue Infections, that are not (but are closely related to) necrotising fasciitis. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: patient + patient">It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a "high risk area" for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii.</span> The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v.</span> Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is " the way forward " as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this "way forward" expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: care + care + care + patient + patient">There remains (now 42 months post Mr GEBRSSLASIEs death) no door top alarms on the patient bedroom doors at Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, at the Caludon Centre. vii.</span> The cumulative effect (there ‘seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1 st May 2025.

[REDACTED], Chief Executive of Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Heath Westerman, H.M. Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 12 July 2023 Mr Ellery, H.M. Senior Coroner for Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin commenced an investigation into the death of William Stephen GREEN The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 February 2025 The conclusion of the inquest was: William Stephen Green died on 9 July 2023 at The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, Mytton Oak Road, Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He died as the result of toxic epidermal necrolysis secondary to Lamotrigine. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">This is a rare but recognised complication arising from taking Lamotrigine which was prescribed to Mr Green for the required treatment of his then known symptoms from 5 June 2023 until its cessation on or around 8 July 2023.</span> Those complications, however, were not counselled or alerted to Mr Green upon his discharge from the hospital on 7 June 2023, nor was he advised on what to look out for and what to do in such circumstances. His death was contributed to by alcohol dependent disease. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Green was admitted to The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, Mytton Oak Road, Shrewsbury, Shropshire on 5 June 2023 following a seizure probably alcohol related. He was started on Lamotrigine an anti-epileptic at a dose of 25mg once daily. He was discharged on 7 June 2023 with a pack of 56 Lamotrigine tablets at a dose of 25mg to be taken one daily. His compliance with taking the Lamotrigine once in the community is not known. He was re-admitted to The Royal Shrewbury Hospital on 5 July 2023 following a collapse and with a rash on his chest, back and upper limbs. He was treated for sepsis secondary to viral meningitis. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">A treatment plan was followed which included Lamotrigine to be administered once daily at the rate of 25mg.</span> His condition deteriorated and on 8 July 2023 he was diagnosed with Steven Johnstone Syndrome. He died on 9 July 2023 as the result of toxic epidermal necrolysis secondary to Lamotrigine. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + patient + record">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Once any patient at The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital is initiated on a new prescribed drug during an admission, no written record is ever made anywhere by anyone including pharmacy; nurses; doctors or consultants explaining or counselling the patient upon the possible side-effects or complications as a result of taking a specific prescribed drug; nor is there any written record on what to look out for and what to do in such circumstances and where they can get assistance. (2) No provision seems to be in place to record what should happen when the patient lacks capacity to understand such an explanation even when it is offered. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25 April 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED]. I have also sent a copy to [REDACTED] from the Trust. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

(2) No provision seems to be in place to record what should happen when the patient lacks capacity to understand such an explanation even when it is offered. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25 April 2025.</td>

This report is being sent to: Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Louise Slater, Area Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) District 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 5 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Khadija Kerri. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest with a Narrative conclusion of: Khadija Kerri died primarily as a result of heart disease, but her death occurred on a background of traumatic injuries sustained in an unwitnessed fall and other co-morbidities. The medical cause of death : 1a Acute Coronary Event 1b Ischaemic Heart Disease, Cardiomegaly, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy 1c II Fall, Multiple Fractures, Dementia, Type II Diabetes Mellitus 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Khadija Kerri was admitted to Doncaster Royal Infirmary on the 19th June 2024 with a head laceration and multiple traumatic injuries following an unwitnessed fall downstairs at her home. CT scans were undertaken and reported by Everlight Radiology (a remote third party). These scan were reported on the 19th June 2024. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: peer review + review">Following a routine peer review the next day, a discrepancy in radiological report was identified and the original CT report had missed two cervical fractures and a rib fracture.</span> An addendum report was issued and a telephone call made to Doncaster Royal Infirmary to advised of the new findings. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: information + team">Despite the addendum report being uploaded on the shared system and a telephone call being made to the Emergency Department at Doncaster Royal Infirmary on the evening of the 20th June 2024, this information was not communicated to or acted acted upon by the clinical team caring for Ms Kerri until the 23rd June 2024.</span> Following the full extent of her injuries being identified, the fractures were immobilised. Ms Kerri remained in hospital until her death on the 3rd July 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: clear + policy + team">The third party provider identified the missed fractures within 24 hours and communicated this to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, however, this was not acted upon until the 23rd June 2024 due to there being no clear internal policy of disseminating an addendum report and/or it contents to the treating team.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Strangulated femoral hernia I found: On 16 th February 2024 Pamela Anne Marking - who was unable to give a complete history due to cognitive issues - was admitted to the Emergency Department at East Surrey Hospital.

A rapid sequence induction (RSI) of anaesthesia to protect her airway from aspiration of gastric contents was undertaken with Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (Propofol and Remifentanil and thereafter Rocuronium), in the absence of cricoid pressure and with a nasogastric tube in situ attached to the only suction device. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Lack of public understanding of the role of Physician Associate Witnesses from the Trust gave evidence that a Physician Associate was clinically equivalent to a Tier 2 resident doctor without evidence to support this belief. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

Lack of ‘Updated' Guidelines for use of Cricoid pressure and other measures to protect the airway in a RSI anaesthetic Evidence was heard that as cricoid pressure was ineffective it was not routinely applied for a RSI intubation. After aspiration on Induction, the only suction device was attached to the nasogastric tube giving rise to a possible delay in timely suctioning of the feculent aspirate which was in excess of two litres after intubation was achieved. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES I have sent a copy of this report to the following: 1. Mr Marking - Son In addition to this report, I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who, he believes, may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Roughly four months before her death Amy had undergone an emergency alcohol detoxification in a hospital setting whilst on the waiting list for alcohol services from a third sector agency. Amy had engaged with a number of third sector agencies in the two years before her death to help with her alcohol addiction, but her engagement had been sporadic, and she often disengaged. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: BCUHB, Ysbyty Gwynedd, Penrhosgarnedd, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 2PW. 1 CORONER I am John Adrian Gittins, Senior Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 3 rd of May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ann Margaret Cotgrove (DOB 10.08.51 DOD 03.05.22). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 20 th of February 2025. The cause of death was recorded as being due to 1(a) Peritonitis , Acute Liver Failure and Bronchopneumonia 1b Gall Bladder Perforation 1c Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to obstructive jaundice and the conclusion of the inquest was that the death was due to medical misadventure. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are that Miss Cotgrave had been admitted to Glan Clwyd Hospital on the 31 st of March 2022 and was being investigated to establish the cause of her jaundice. She did not undergo a required ERCP until the 19 th of April and on the 22 nd of April was found to have sustained a perforation which is likely to have occurred in the course of that procedure. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">By that time she was too unwell to undergo reparative surgery and she passed away on the 3 rd of May 2022.</span> The delay in her undergoing the ERCP was due (inter alia) to the consultant gastroenterologist requesting that advice from tertiary centre in Liverpool be obtained prior to the procedure due to a suspicion of malignancy. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency

A Regulation 28 Report - Action to Prevent Future Deaths THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Chief Executive Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Trust Headquarters East Surrey Hospital Canada Avenue Redhill RH1 5RH 1 CORONER Ms Susan Ridge, H.M. Assistant Coroner for Surrey 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners and Justice Act 2009. 3 INQUEST An inquest into Mrs Rodgers death was opened on 25 July 2024. The inquest was resumed on 27 January 2025 and concluded on 19 February 2025. The medical cause of Mrs Rodgers' death was: 1a.Congestive Cardiac Failure 1b Aortic Stenosis and Urinary Tract Infection 2. Rib and Spinal Fractures, Decubitus Ulcer (operated) and Frailty of Old Age 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest as follows: On 3 December 2023, Margaret Kathleen Rodgers had a fall at her home in Warlingham Surrey. She was taken to hospital the same day and found to have sustained rib fractures and spinal fracture and was admitted to East Surrey Hospital. Mrs Rodgers developed hospital acquired pneumonia during her admission for which she was treated. On 14 December 2023 she was found to have an unstageable or advanced sacral pressure ulcer, its development and progress had not been identified until that point. As a result Mrs Rogers required two surgical procedures, on 21 December and 27 December 2023, under general anaesthetic to treat the infected ulcer. Whilst in hospital Mrs Rodgers developed a urinary tract infection and this together with preadmission aortic stenosis and cardiac failure led to her death from congestive cardiac failure on 12 January 2024 at East Surrey Hospital Redhill. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Secretary of State of The Department of Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Alison Mutch , senior coroner, for the coroner area of Manchester South 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11 th September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kenneth James CLAYTON.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 th January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was NARRATIVE: Died from the complications of an unobserved fall that occurred in the Emergency Department during a prolonged wait for an inpatient bed. The medical cause of death was 1a) Bronchopneumonia 1b) Neck of Femur Fracture (operated on) 1c) Fall II) Frailty, Vascular Dementia, Acute Kidney Injury. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kenneth James Clayton was taken to Tameside General Hospital after two falls at his home address. He was assessed as requiring inpatient admission to a medical ward. Whilst waiting for an inpatient bed to become available he had an unobserved fall in the Emergency Department. He was found to have fractured his neck of femur and was operated on. Post operatively he deteriorated and developed complications from the fracture and operation. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He died at Tameside General Hospital on 23rd August 2024. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: factor + time + factor + factor">The inquest heard evidence that a key factor in the fall was the prolonged time Mr Clayton was in the Emergency Department waiting for a bed to become available on a ward.</span> The evidence was that he had been in the emergency department for about 8 hours when he fell. The inquest was told that the design of an Emergency Department is not suited to a need for prolonged observation of high falls risk patients. In addition generally patients are cared for on hospital trolleys which cannot be lowered in the way a hospital bed can be which further increases the risk of falls. 2. Prolonged waits in Emergency Department were on the evidence given to the inquest not unusual. As an example the court was told that on the morning the inquest was heard there were patients who had been waiting 40 hours for a bed on a ward. 3. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)

Keywords: care + care">The evidence given was that the main challenge in freeing up beds was delayed discharge of patients who were medically ready for discharge but who needed a care package or a care home place to facilitate a safe discharge. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">The inquest was told that for patient safety it was important, that whilst there were delays in ED throughput of patients, that a robust falls risk management system was in place.</span> Tameside Hospital had put additional measures in place to manage falls risk in ED in a more consistent way but it was unclear what steps were in place nationally to manage falls risk in a consistent way in Emergency Departments. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 16 th April 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

This report is being sent to: Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust
Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Officer Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Anne Bryans House 77 Fleet Road London NW3 2QG 1 CORONER I am Ian Potter, assistant coroner for Inner North London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 August 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Carl Edmond EASTMAN, aged 96 years at the time of his death.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 17 December 2024 and 5 February 2025 at St Pancras Coroner's Court. The conclusion of the inquest was ‘accident'. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: concerns">Mr Eastman died in hospital on the evening of 28 July 2024, as a direct result of the injury sustained in the unwitnessed fall in the ward earlier that day. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of my investigation and the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. I heard evidence from both a consultant geriatrician and the head of nursing for the AMEDEC division. I was provided with an action plan from the Trust, which sets out numerous measures that the Trust has already put in place or plans to put in place. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The concerns I am bringing to your attention by way of this report, relate to matters that do not appear, as yet, to have been considered by the Trust.</span> The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows: 1. The consultant geriatrician's evidence was that CT scan was requested to take place ‘as soon as possible' following the first unwitnessed fall on 25 July 2024; however, they accepted that this was not conducted in a timely manner. a) Further, following the second unwitnessed fall on 28 July 2024, there was a further delay in a CT scan taking place. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">I was told that this scan should have been conducted within 1-2 hours of the request being made, yet it took place over three hours after the patient was reviewed by the doctor and the request for the scan was made. b) In Mr Eastman's case, the delays in receiving the scans transpired to be immaterial in the particular circumstances.</span> However, I am concerned that if delays in such scans, where traumatic injury is suspected, are repeated in the future, there is a risk that deaths could occur. 2. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor

Keywords: staff + staff">These included: When the on-call doctor attended to review Mr Eastman at approximately 02:45 on 28 July 2024, ward staff (incorrectly) told the doctor that nobody had fallen on the ward, which lead to the doctor leaving the ward without Mr Eastman having been reviewed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

This report is being sent to: Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The President, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health 1 CORONER HM Assistant Coroner Peter Merchant for Greater Manchester South 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 29 April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Yahya Muhammad HAYAT. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 February 2025, having been heard on 30 and 31 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Yahya Muhammad Hayat was born at Tameside Hospital at 05:02 hours on 12 April 2024. He died at Royal Oldham Hospital on 25 April 2024, his death being confirmed at 16:42hours. Yahya's mother had previously given birth by way of a caesarean section and was therefore classified during her pregnancy with Yahya as a high risk pregnancy. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Physical characteristics + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Keywords: review">It was not known how long Yahya's foetal heart rate had been abnormal, given the previous review before 04:15hours was undertaken at 03:15 hours on 12th April 2024.</span> Yahya was born at 05:02 hours. In the course of undertaking the category I caesarean section, a uterine rupture was identified. It is not known when this occurred. There were missed opportunities to have delivered Yahya sooner. However, on the evidence it is not known whether earlier delivery would have avoided Yahya's death. The medical cause of death was given as: 1a Severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 1b 1c Maternal uterine rupture at birth of baby II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Term baby born at Tameside Hospital after maternal uterine rupture leading to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Baby born in very poor condition with first heart rate detected at 35 minutes of age after receiving resuscitation at birth. There is serious incident investigation at Tameside regarding the events leading to Yahya's birth in poor condition Presenting condition and initial diagnosis Yahya was born at 40+2 weeks of gestation at Tameside Hospital via Em CS due to maternal uterine rupture. Yahya was born in very poor condition, requiring chest compressions and several resuscitation drugs via intraosseous needle line as UVC insertion was unsuccessful. Yahya was successfully intubated at ~30min of life and a heart rate was first detected at ~35minutes of life. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: care + care">Yahya was transferred on day 1 of life to Royal Oldham Hospital for ongoing intensive care of severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE).</span> Yahya remained ventilated from birth, requiring minimal settings but did not demonstrate central drive to breath. Significant cardiovascular support was required, totalling with 4 simultaneous inotropes required to manage hypotension. Hypotension was associated with very high lactates. Inotropes were gradually weaned and stopped on day 4. BP was monitored using a peripheral arterial line. On Day 8 Yahya was again briefly started on adrenaline infusion in view of Low Bp but that was stopped shortly after. Yahya was initially kept nil by mouth and remained on IV fluids. Post re-warming Yahya was started on feeds; and only managed to reach on 1/2 fluids and 1/2 feeds. Yahya was fed by nasogastric tube and never given oral feeds as he did not have safe swallowing. Yahya had no gag or cough reflexes. Yahya's therapeutic hypothermia was commenced within first 6 hours of life, having met criteria A (prolonged resuscitation and very low pH) and criteria B (poor neurological examination) shortly after birth. Yahya went on to develop clinical seizures with correlation CFAM changes. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues
Keywords: maintenance">These were managed with phenobarbitone, followed by loading and maintenance levetiracetam.</span> Cranial ultrasound suggested features of severe HIE. In addition, there is biochemical evidence of a global hypoxic event including markedly deranged liver enzymes and elevated troponin (cardiac enzymes). <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: poorly">Since arrival on the unit, Yahya has examined poorly from a neurological perspective.</span> His pupils have been fixed and dilated throughout his stay with no spontaneous movements, no gag or cough reflex, no primitive reflexes, global hypotonia and areflexia. An in-house cranial ultrasound on day 2 of life showed generalised oedema and features in keeping with severe HIE. Yahya's brain MRI showed severe total intracranial injury. His brain was oedematous with mass effect and central brain herniation and compression of midline structures. Appearances most in keeping with severe hypoxic ischaemic injury. Yahya's brain MRI was discussed with paediatric neurologists at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital who had the same conclusion as above. Yahya's EGG was reported as severe abnormal EEG. He had isoelectric EEG. Yahya's renal function progressively declined since admission. This was associated with hyperkalaemia, requiring calcium gluconate, salbutamol and continuous insulin and dextrose infusion. Additionally, Yahya's biochemistry has shown hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia which have required corrective infusions. Yahya has had hyperglycaemia required insulin infusion. Yahya's haemoglobin has remained acceptable through the NICU stay but he had thrombocytopenia requiring a platelet top up on 19/04/2024. Yahya's clotting profile was also deranged. Yahya received Vitamin K at birth, along with an additional dose of vitamin K later with cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma. Parents were kept up to date throughout their stay in the hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The court heard evidence of changes to paediatric specialist training that has removed the requirement that paediatric middle grades undergo compulsory direct observed training to be assessed as competent to perform neonatal intubation. The following matters of concern arise from this : (1) The fact training is no longer compulsory, increases the reliance on consultants ( who in some clinical settings may be non-resident on call depending when delivery takes place) ; and (2) Consultant general paediatricians of the future will have a lower level of experience than is currently the case of complex neonatal resuscitation 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 April 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Talbots Law on behalf of the family. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive(s) of Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust 1 CORONER I am James Puzey, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Worcestershire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 January 2024 HMSC David Reid commenced an investigation into the death of Katrina Veronica Francesca Insleay, aged 90.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 December 2024 which I heard. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was Sepsis due to an infected sacral pressure sore and pneumonia. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 1. Katrina Insleay died on 1 January 2024 at the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch from sepsis due to an infected pressure sore and pneumonia. Ms. Insleay went into hospital on 18 November 2023 with what was a low-grade pressure sore. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: patient">Evidence was given at the inquest by a Clinical lead with the Pershore and Upton Neighbourhood team that Ms Insleay was discharged home from Worcestershire Royal Hospital on 4 December 2023 and that the Pershore and Upton Neighbourhood Team received a telephone call from the patient discharge unit at the hospital that day.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Information received was that Miss Insleay had a grade 2 pressure to her sacrum which had developed in hospital.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">The Neighbourhood team were asked to visit the patient on Thursday 07/12/2024 to redress the sacral pressure ulcer and check the hip wound.</span> They were advised that the sacral pressure sore should be redressed twice weekly. A visit was planned for the 07/12/2024. 3. In fact, the pressure sore was at least a grade 3. I was told that pressure sore assessment is, to a degree a subjective exercise of judgment but the evidence in this case was that the grading of the sore by the hospital as a grade 2 was clearly wrong. 4. As it happens the Neighbourhood Team visited on 5 December 2023 because it was reported to them that the dressing had come away from the wound. However, owing to miscommunication the results of the swaps taken of the pressure sore were not acted upon promptly and the pressure sore developed an infection which became worse and sepsis was the result. 5. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The evidence from the clinical lead was that the Neighbourhood Team ("NT") and the Hospital had completely different record keeping systems and the NT could not simply check the hospital records without specifically requesting them.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The handover between hospital and NT for patients being discharged from hospital was often by telephone and only sometimes was there a handwritten form.</span> There was no formal, documented handover procedure that was capable of being checked. The NT did not always receive the discharge letter. The images of Ms Insleay's wound that were taken at the hospital were not available for the NT to view unless they specifically requested them. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + between + between">Consequently, absent the dressing becoming loose, there would have been no visit between 4 and 7 December 2023 and the actual state of the pressure sore would not have been observed until even later. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between, patient">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The absence of a formal, documented handover system between hospital and Neighbourhood Team and the fact that the NT cannot simply check hospital records of patients with pressure sores to verify their condition without specifically requesting records creates the potential for the NT to fail to appreciate the true condition of a patient's pressure sores when they are discharged from hospital and for follow up to be delayed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] — Royal Free Hospital Chief Executive Pond St, London NW3 2QG 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS John Tompkins (date of birth 11/9/50) died on 25 July 2024 at Royal Free Hospital (RFH), following treatment received for a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.</span> Mr Tompkins had been admitted to Royal Free Hospital in July 2024 and underwent a hepatic artery embolisation and right-sided portal vein embolisation. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: time">However, owing to how the requests had been received, they were undertaken at the same time.</span> Before the procedures were undertaken, attempts were made to discuss the MDT plan with the surgical Consultant. However, he was on leave and not contactable. Mr Tompkins subsequently developed acute-on-chronic liver failure and sadly died from consequential multiorgan failure on 25 July 2024. I heard the inquest into his death on 6 December 2024 and reached a narrative conclusion as follows: Mr Tompkins died from a recognised complication, arising from necessary medical procedures. These procedures were undertaken simultaneously, rather than sequentially, as had initially been intended. This simultaneous approach more than minimally contributed to his death. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: consent + issues">At the inquest there was limited evidence as to what steps had been taken by RFH to address the risk of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances, including issues with how requests for procedures were undertaken, whether consent for these procedures included the risk of death and how novel procedures are considered by RFH before they are implemented.</span> Following the inquest I received a response from RFH which predominantly addressed the points raised (attached entitled ‘Procedure Requesting Process). <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Mr Tompkins' death were as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: time + review">I am concerned that there was limited internal review of the circumstances of Mr Tompkins' death, following identification that the procedures were undertaken at the same time; 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">Further and linked to the above, I am concerned that the Trust seemingly did not consider the NatSSIPS2 standards either when undertaking the procedures, nor in detail as part of its review following the inquest. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressee has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 April 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, Mr Tompkins' family, the hospital Trust and the CQC. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Royal College of Psychiatrists
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists 21 Prescot Street London E1 8BB 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS Nicholas J'Dourou (date of birth 29 August 1977) died on 15 April 2024, whilst admitted as a voluntary patient at Highgate Acute Mental Health Centre (‘Highgate').</span> He died from asphyxiation which arose from the placement of a ligature around his neck. His death was contributed to by a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">I heard the inquest into his death on 24 January 2025 and reached the conclusion of suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Nicholas had long-standing mental health diagnoses and had been detained under the Mental Health Act on several previous occasions.</span> His mood deteriorated at the beginning of 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: medication + mental health">He was admitted to Highgate in early April, after initial failed attempts to improve his mental health in the community setting, through altering his medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">On review by the ward consultant, his background diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder was queried and a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder was favoured.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: staff">He was under ‘general observations', meaning that staff were supposed to be monitoring him on an hourly basis.</span> Sadly, on the late morning of the 15 April, he was found in his room with a ligature around his neck. Signs indicated that he died several hours previously. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: staff">After inspection of CCTV and records of supposed observations, it was apparent that staff had not monitored Nicholas as had been intended.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Deceased name: Leslie Hurwood
Coroners name: Jonathan Dixey
Coroners Area: Northamptonshire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: NORTHAMPTON GENERAL HOSPITAL NHS TRUST
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: NORTHAMPTON GENERAL HOSPITAL NHS TRUST 1 CORONER I am Jonathan Dixey, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Northamptonshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18 January 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mr Leslie Hurwood. On 5 February 2025 the inquest hearing began and is due to conclude tomorrow (6 February 2025). 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Hurwood died on 13 January 2023 at Kettering General Hospital. He had a history of Type I diabetes mellitus (from 1969), hyperlipidaemia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma and essential hypertension. He had recently been diagnosed with dementia. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Until 2022 his diabetes was well-managed. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - In December 2022 Mr Hurwood was an in-patient at Northampton General Hospital.</span> This followed a fall at home. During this admission he suffered multiple episodes of hypoglycaemia. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Mr Hurwood's insulin medication was to be provided by nurses within the hospital.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: review + staff + staff">I have heard evidence from a Diabetes Specialist Nurse at the Diabetes Centre at Northampton General Hospital that on 12 December 2022 Mr Hurwood was referred by ward staff for a diabetes review.</span> The Diabetes Specialist Nurse explained in evidence that she observed that nurses (plural) were administering Mr Hurwood's insulin after meals. She advised the nurses that Mr Hurwood's insulin should be provided before his meals. In evidence, the Diabetes Specialist Nurse told me: Insulin should be administered prior eating. Its effectiveness is reduced if not administered before eating. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">This was not the only time that she was aware that nurses at Northampton General Hospital were (incorrectly) administering insulin to patients after they had eaten their meals.</span> This continues to happen "occasionally": the most recent episode which she had directly encountered occurred in the last 2 to 3 months. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: training">Whilst the Diabetes Centre members have had discussions with nurses and training does occur "the message does get through for some people".</span> The implication - which she agreed was the correct implication - was that the "message" did not get through to other nurses. A former Ward Sister at Northampton General Hospital has also given evidence at the inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">She agreed that staff must get insulin administration correct.</span> She thought the incorrect administration of insulin after a meal "probably does happen". <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">She accepted that there was "no excuse" for this, but pointed to the possible contributory effect of a lack of staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3 April 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Mr Hurwood's family. Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. St Matthews Healthcare. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) British Society for Haematology (BSH) NHS England 1 CORONER I am Elizabeth GRAY, Area Coroner for the coroner area of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 27 June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Amelia Alexandra Anuszka RIDOUT aged 6.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 March 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Amelia Ridout underwent a bilateral bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure at Addenbrookes Hospital on 16th June 2022 following a diagnosis of pancytopenia. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic process
Keywords: differential diagnosis">A bilateral bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure was carried out by a Paediatric Oncology Specialist Doctor whose understanding at the time was that Amelia Ridout's differential diagnosis still included the possibility of a solid cancer which would require a bilateral bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure to ensure accurate diagnosis.</span> The Senior Clinical Fellow in Paediatric Haematology who had asked for the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure to proceed had not specified whether the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure was to be a unilateral or bilateral procedure. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: attendance">The bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure was carried out under general anaesthetic with a Consultant Anaesthetist in attendance.</span> Amelia Ridout was positioned on her left side for the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure. The right sided bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure was completed. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling

Keywords: review">The supervising Consultant Haematologist was called in to review and confirmed that there was no signs to raise concern and that the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure should be concluded.</span> Amelia Ridout remained positioned on her left side for the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure in line with the training and practise adopted by the Paediatric Oncology Specialist Doctor. Shortly after the conclusion of the left sided bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure at 11.32am, Amelia Ridout started to decompensate and rapidly went into Pulseless Electrical Activity arrest (PEA arrest). Full Advanced Paediatric Life Saving procedures were commenced. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic process + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: differential diagnosis + team">The paediatric resuscitation team attended promptly, the on call Paediatric Surgeon was alerted and it was rapidly established and agreed based on Amelia Ridout's differential diagnosis that Amelia Ridout was suffering an internal bleed as a result of the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure which needed to be dealt with through surgical intervention as a priority.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: access + team">Central Venous lines and arterial access were sited by the Anaesthetic team,to allow them the ability to provide life saving resuscitation to Amelia Ridout inter-operatively.</span> On arrival at the Operating Theatre, Amelia Ridout was relatively stable as a result of the continued resuscitation efforts. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">The clinical team managing the emergency laparotomy anticipated that invasive surgery could lead to a rapid destabilisation in Amelia Ridout's condition.</span> Shortly after the start of Amelia Ridout's surgery, Amelia Ridout went into PEA arrest and needed chest compressions. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">The surgical team continued to treat Amelia Ridout'sinternal injury and identified a defect in the anterior arterial wall of the external iliac artery, the appearances of which were consistent with the anticipated needle injury caused by the bone marrow aspirate and trephine procedure.</span> Amelia Ridout's condition continued to deteriorate despite continued resuscitation efforts. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">The clinical team took the decision that continued efforts would be futile and Amelia Ridout was declared deceased. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 6-year-old girl with suspected aplastic anaemia attended the paediatric day unit on 16th June for a minor surgical procedure under general anaesthetic (a bone marrow aspirate and trephine).</span> During the procedure, the trephine needle accidentally penetrated through the pelvic bone and pierced the iliac vessels causing massive, catastrophic bleeding internally. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Following prolonged resuscitation, she was transferred to theatre under paediatric and vascular surgical teams, but the bleeding could not be stopped, and after further prolonged resuscitation attempts, she died in theatre. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

REGULATION 28 - REPORT ON ACTION TO PREVENT OTHER DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care [REDACTED], Chief Executive, NHS England 1 CORONER I am Mrs.</span> Catherine Wood, Assistant Coroner for North East Kent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dorothy Lilian REID. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was a Narrative "She died as a consequence of a pulmonary embolism which developed following period of reduced mobility due to a fall where she sustained thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures due in part to her underlying osteoporosis." 1a Massive Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism 1b Deep Vein Thrombosis 1c 1d II Ischaemic Heart Disease, Atherosclerosis 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Dorothy Reid was a 91 year old woman who had a medical history of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis as well as anxiety but was independent and living in an annexe of her daughter's home. She fell on 13 March 2024 and was seen in the minor injuries unit where she was assessed and sent home after her head wound was treated. She subsequently contacted her general practitioner who advised her to have an x-ray which was arranged for 21 March 2024. Spinal fractures were identified on the x-ray and she was referred to the emergency department at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (QEQM) hospital and kept overnight before undergoing an MRI scan which confirmed the fractures and advice was sought from the regional neurosurgical department and advice given for her to mobilise and take analgesia. She was seen by an occupational therapist on 26 March 2024 who was concerned about her level of breathlessness and alerted her general practitioner. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">She was seen by the practice paramedic and gave a history of breathing difficulty after exertion for a few months, worse over the last couple of months and other than breathlessness on exertion she had no signs or symptoms requiring further treatment.</span> On 31 March 2024 her daughter contacted the 111 service and an ambulance attended around 11pm by which time she was complaining of shortness of breath and had bilateral swollen feet and lower legs with no chest pain, but chest tightness after exertion. An ECG revealed widespread T wave inversion and although the ambulance crew advised that she should attend hospital she wanted to avoid a trip to hospital due to her previously having to wait in discomfort for hours and a referral was made to the out of hours general practitioner service instead. She was seen by a general practitioner on 1 April 2024 around 9.30am and gave a history of shortness of breath only on exertion and had bilateral swollen legs although denied chest pain or palpitations and the ECG taken by the paramedics was reviewed and noted. She was assessed and referred for further investigations and given advice to call an ambulance if her symptoms deteriorated. An ambulance was called just after 7pm on 2nd April 2024 and she was taken to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital arriving shortly after around 9pm. She was triaged and left to wait in the waiting room as the department was busy. She deteriorated whilst waiting to be seen by a doctor and was transferred from the corridor to the RAT area and seen by a doctor who considered that she was very unwell and transferred her to the resuscitation department where she suffered a cardiac arrest. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">A return of circulation was achieved and a bedside echocardiogram was suggestive of a pulmonary embolus but it was thought she was unlikely to survive treatment and a decision was made to keep her comfortable and she died shortly after 3.30am on 3 April 2024.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">A post mortem confirmed a pulmonary embolus was the cause of her death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) During the course of the evidence it became clear that on both attendances to the emergency department at QEQM she had to wait on a chair as there were no beds.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: attendance">The first attendance led to such a poor experience that she chose not to go back to hospital when an ambulance was called on 31 March 2024.</span> Had she gone to hospital on 31 March 2024 when advised to do so it is likely that her pulmonary embolus would have been diagnosed in the emergency department and treated and she would not have died when she did. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: staff + staff + attendance">Delays in being seen by a doctor at the second attendance were of concern but were found not to be causative of her death. (2) Both attendances at the emergency department were on busy shifts but evidence heard from staff was that this was not unusual and the reasons being that beds in the hospital are blocked by patients who are medically fit for discharge.</span> The evidence heard was that on average around 25% of the hospital beds were filled with patients who did not need to be there which in turn leads to patients who need to be admitted not having a bed to be admitted into. This in turn leads to patients waiting in the emergency department for a bed. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">This places unnecessary pressure on the emergency departments and leads to delays for those seeking emergency treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: analysis + national, local">The evidence heard suggested that this was a national not local problem. (3) When asked about whether the delays led to a risk of deaths to others evidence was brought to the courts attention that the President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has published an analysis of the impact that this is having and that there are a significant number deaths associated with long waits in the emergency department.</span> This, in conjunction with the reluctance of patients to attend the emergency department due to long waiting times clearly gives rise to a risk of future deaths unless something is done. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 April 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons her family, East Kent hospitals NHS Trust and The Broadstairs Medical Practice. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 4 February 2025 Signature Catherine Wood Assistant Coroner for North East Kent

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Devon Partnership NHS Trust The Pembroke Medical Practice Devon ICB Medicines and Healthcare Projects Regulation Authority 1 CORONER I am Louise Wiltshire, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of the County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Antony NORTHCOTT.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 January 2025. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was as follows: William Anthony Northcott died from a sudden cardiac arrhythmia caused by the combined effect of background of an enlarged heart and left ventricular hypertrophy. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: medication">He was on medication for this condition, which included clozapine and fluoxetine.</span> Both of these medications were appropriately prescribed and maintained at therapeutic levels prior to his death. On 13 July 2021, William was found deceased in his room at Georgian House. Post mortem examination revealed an enlarged heart and left ventricular hypotrophy. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling
Keywords: analysis">Clozapine and fluoxetine were identified during toxicological analysis post mortem at levels which were consistent with therapeutic use in life.</span> Amphetamine was found at levels consistent with recreational use. Clozapine, Fluoxetine and amphetamine are all cardio-toxic drugs, which carry risk of causing sudden cardiac arrhythmia. An enlarged heart and left ventricular hypertrophy also carry a risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmia. The combination of clozapine, fluoxetine and amphetamine on the background of William's enlarged heart caused William to suffer a sudden fatal cardiac arrhythmia. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: care + care + national">I am also concerned that this limitation is likely to extend further than the 40% of patients in receipt of Clozapine under the care of Devon Partnership NHS Trust and that this may be a national issue.</span> At post mortem examination William was found to have a significantly enlarged heart and left ventricular hypertrophy. This was not known to those caring for William in life. Clozapine is a cardiotoxic drug, and is often used in conjunction with other drugs which may also have a cardiotoxic effect. The risk of myocarditis is reasonably well explained in Devon Partnership NHS Trust's policy documentation, but there is less of a focus on cardiomyopathies which would include left ventricular hypertrophy. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + national, guidance">I understand that the Trust's guidance is based on national guidance.</span> Annual ECGs are required for patients prescribed Clozapine and questions about cardiac function will now be asked at monthly Clozapine clinics. However, I understand that ECGs are not a diagnostic tool used to assist in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathies such as left ventricular hypertrophy and that left ventricular hypertrophy can be asymptomatic. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">I also understand that an echocardiogram may be able to identify such cardiomyopathies, but that this is not currently required on initiation of Clozapine or routinely at any other time whilst a patient is taking Clozapine.</span> I am concerned that these cardiomyopathies could therefore go undetected in patients prescribed Clozapine and leave them at unknown increased risk of fatal cardiac arrythmias, as occurred in William's case. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons; the family, Viatris and Georgian House. I have also sent it to NHS England and the Royal College of Psychiatrists who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Louise Wiltshire 27 January 2025

This report is being sent to: Circle Health Group Ltd
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Officer, Circle Health Group Ltd. 1 st Floor, 30 Cannon Street, London EC4M 6XH. 1 CORONER I am Chris Morris, Area Coroner for Greater Manchester (South). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18 TH April 2024, I opened an inquest into the death of Terence Grainger, who died on 10th February 2024 at The Alexandra Hospital, Cheadle, aged 61 years. The investigation concluded with an inquest which I heard on 22 nd and 24 th January, and 4 th February 2025. A post mortem examination determined Mr Grainger died as a consequence of:- 1) a) Acute left thoracic cavity haemorrhage b) Removal of left-sided intercostal drain c) Drainage of pleural effusion following coronary artery bypass graft surgery for ischaemic heart disease due to coronary artery atheroma. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: concerns + guidance + guidance">The conclusion of the inquest was a Narrative Conclusion, to the effect that Mr Grainger died as a consequence of complications arising from chest drain insertion under ultrasound guidance, which first became apparent after the chest drain had been removed. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Grainger died on 10 th February 2024 at The Alexandra Hospital, Cheadle as a consequence of an acute left thoracic cavity haemorrhage due to removal of a left-sided intercostal drain which had been placed to drain a pleural effusion following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, together with [REDACTED] on behalf of Mr Grainger's family, and the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland and [REDACTED] on behalf of the other Interested Persons. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Somerset NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Somerset NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Vanessa McKinlay, Assistant Coroner for Somerset 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 27 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Cynthia Mary Gilbert. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 January 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + gaps + care + care">The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs Gilbert died as a result of natural causes contributed to by gaps in the implementation of the pressure ulcer care plan in hospital. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Against a background of cardiac and respiratory illness, Mrs Gilbert's mobility had deteriorated at home.</span> She was found on the morning of 30 August 2023 on the toilet, where she had been all night having been unable to stand herself up. She was admitted to Musgrove Park Hospital where she was discovered to have an infective exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and grade 2 tissue injuries to the sacrum and buttocks. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + gaps + care + care">During a long hospital admission, Mrs Gilbert's pressure ulcers deteriorated and became infected, owing in part to her multiple co-morbidities and in part to gaps in the implementation of her repositioning care plan.</span> This caused septicaemia from which Mrs Gilbert died in hospital on 20 December 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: a) Mrs Gilbert was noted to have grade 2 tissue damage on admission to hospital. She was assessed as being at very high risk of pressure ulcer development. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: time + staff + staff + team">The Intentional Rounding documents show that, during her time spent on the Old Acute Medical Unit and Coleridge Respiratory Unit (1/9/23 to 20/12/23), Mrs Gilbert remained in the same position in bed for periods of many hours on multiple days. b) Evidence given by the tissue viability nurse was that the tissue viability team emphasised the importance of repositioning on five separate occasions to the ward staff.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: [REDACTED] (Mrs Gilbert's daughter).

This report is being sent to: Aneurin Bevan University Health Board
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Chief Executive of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board 1 CORONER I am Caroline Saunders, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Gwent. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 02 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jean THOMAS aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 October 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Accident 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jean Thomas fell at home on 20/10/23 and fractured her hip. She underwent surgical fixation but developed post-operative sepsis. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: concerns + conditions">Against the background of her underlying medical conditions the infection proved overwhelming and Jean died at the Grange University Hospital in Llanfrechfa on 26/10/2023. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Jean was known to have significant cardiovascular problems and from her admission there were signs this was worsening. Her blood pressure was low, which would normally be treated with intravenous fluids, but excess fluids would put more pressure on her heart, and thus she was also treated with a low dose of furosemide. The management of Jean's fluid balance was important for the following reasons; she had heart failure, she had chronic renal failure, she had signs of a superimposing acute kidney injury and she was scoring on the NEWS chart from admission, such that the algorithm required the fluid balance to be monitored. Jean had signs of sepsis. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: care + care + care + staff + staff + staff">Whilst I could not find that knowledge of Jean's fluid balance would have altered the outcome, it is a matter of grave concern that this basic nursing care was ignored, and these important clinical indicators not monitored by the medical staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 December 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Health Inspectorate Wales I have also sent it to Family Members Of Jean Thomas who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Elysium Healthcare
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Elysium Healthcare 1 CORONER I am Caroline Saunders, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Gwent. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 01 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Huw Irwin ERASMUS aged 34. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 05 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion Narrative Conclusion - Huw Irwin Erasmus was at risk of eating vegetation present in the grounds of the Aderyn Unit in Pontypool. Huw died from the toxic effects of consuming a large quantity of Yew leaves in the grounds. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Those responsible for his care ought to have known that Yew trees were present, and the leaves were highly toxic and could be fatal if ingested.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: mental health + care + care + care">His death was an accident but it was contributed by a failure of those responsible for his care to identify and manage the risks associated with the ingestion of Yew leaves. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Huw Irwin Erasmus died on 11/11/2022 at Aderyn Unit in Pontypool where he was detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act.</span> Huw died from the toxic effects of consuming a large quantity of Yew leaves. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Huw did not consume the leaves with the intention of ending his life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Huw was detained at Aderyn Mental Health Hospital from 8/8/2022 to 11/8/2022 under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">During that time he was granted unescorted leave within the grounds of the hospital.</span> Huw had a propensity to ingest vegetation and it was a condition of his leave that he refrain from so doing. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: policy + staff">The expectation according to the policy and from staff who gave evidence was that Huw would be assessed following a period of leave.</span> It was also anticipated that this assessment would on occasion include a review of whether Huw had ingested vegetation. There was no documentary evidence in the clinical records that Huw had been so assessed after a period of unescorted leave. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: staff + documentation">There was also confusion amongst staff about the nature of the assessment and the level of documentation required.</span> Ultimately, the issue was whether in fact these assessments had taken place at all. Although in the circumstances this was not a finding made by the jury, it raises the concern that a failure to understand the requirements of a post-leave assessment and suitably document the findings could result in future deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 06 February 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Family Members Of Huw Erasmus I have also sent it to Health Inspectorate Wales who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Samantha GOWARD, Area Coroner for the coroner area of Norfolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carla Marie SMITH aged 38, date of death 07 June 2023.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 January 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The medical cause of death was: 1a) Metastatic Endometrial Cancer 1b) 1c) 2) The conclusion of the inquest was: Died due to a naturally occurring condition, a rapidly progressing cancer, the diagnosis and treatment of which was delayed due to a number of missed opportunities. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Carla Smith had a history of excessive vaginal bleeding.</span> She first attended her GP surgery in July 2022 and an ultrasound scan was arranged. The report received 23 August 2022 showed a thickened endometrium of 22 millimetres. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: review">After a review by a different GP and a discussion with Carla on 27 September 2022, an urgent referral was made with an anticipated wait of 4-6 weeks.</span> When triaged by specialists at the hospital, the referral should have been upgraded to a 2 week wait pathway. Carla was not seen until 31 January 2023. A biopsy on that day was marked as routine instead of 2 week wait. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Assessment, investigation, testing, screening (e.g., holistic review)
Keywords: sample + sample">There was a delay in the sample being processed and this was chased after Carla attended hospital again as an emergency on 15 April 2023 due to ongoing heavy bleeding.</span> A CT scan showed signs suggestive of advanced endometrial malignancy with disseminated metastasis. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: laboratory + treatment + concerns + laboratory">During the course of the Inquest, it was apparent that there were a number of missed opportunities to refer Carla for treatment and to use the correct pathway to do so and there were also significant delays in receiving results from the laboratory and due to lengthy waiting lists, even for urgent referrals. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the course of the evidence, I heard from Consultants at two hospitals, and read evidence from others. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The evidence I heard is that, at that time there were significant waiting lists, even for those on an urgent pathway.</span> <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: waiting time + time">I heard that these issues persist and that, in relation to gynaecology referrals which was the subject of this inquest, where the expected waiting time would previously be 4-6 weeks for an urgent referral, one hospital has a waiting time of 18 weeks, the other 30 weeks (and 60 weeks for routine).</span> I was advised by one Consultant that they do not know how they can catch up with this backlog. I am aware that this is not a problem that is unique to just the two Trusts from whom evidence was heard. 2. The cause for concern is that some patients may significantly deteriorate while on such lengthy waiting lists. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">In some cases, this may mean that they lose some treatment options due to their condition advancing.</span> This leads to a risk of future deaths. 3. The other concern I have following the evidence heard, is that if someone is on a routine or urgent waiting list, there is no requirement or system in place to monitor their progress. I was advised that those referred under a 2 week wait (which I am now advised has been changed to a 28 day wait) for suspected cancer, will be monitored to ensure that the timescale is met. There is no such requirement for the other waiting lists. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: needs">This may lead to patients being left waiting for excessive periods, without any requirement for their case to be reviewed to ascertain if it remains suitable for such a lengthy wait, or if a new referral needs to be made on a different pathway. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 26, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Carla's mother and partner Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust Heacham Group GP Practice I have also sent it to CQC, HSSIB, Healthwatch NHS England & NHS Improvement. who may find it useful or of interest.

This report is being sent to: Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust | London Borough of Lewisham
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], CEO Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, University Hospital Lewisham, Lewisham High Street, Lewisham, London SE13 6LH 2. [REDACTED], Chief Executive, London Borough of Lewisham, Laurence House, 1 Catford Road, London, SE6 4RU 1 CORONER I am Liliane Field for London Inner South 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulation s 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/p aragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 14 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Naomi SULEYMAN. Ms Suleyman died on 9 February 2023 at University Hospital Lewisham, London (UHL) part of Lewisham and Greenwich Trust (LGT) where she had been admitted from her home on 3 January 2023 with complications of an unstageable pressure ulcer. The investigation concluded on 17 January 2025. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: needs">I recorded a narrative conclusion: Naomi Suleyman died from pneumonia and complications of an unstageable sacral pressure sore which she developed having deconditioned and become bedbound following discharge from hospital whilst undergoing assessment of her long-term needs. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Ms Suleyman was admitted to UHL on 06.11.22 with pneumonia.</span> She was noted to have a grade 2 sacral pressure ulcer on admission and subsequently developed a sacral deep tissue injury (DTI) requiring the input of the tissue viability nurses (TVN). The DTI appeared to resolve, resulting in her discharge from the TVN caseload, albeit the grade 2 sacral pressure ulcer remained. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + needs + care + care">She was discharged home on 05.12.22 with a package of care arranged through LGT's and London Borough of Lewisham's (LBL) integrated multi-disciplinary discharge to assess (D2A) service for assessment of her long-term needs and with a referral to LGT's District Nursing Service.</span> By 07.12.22 she had developed a new DTI. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The DTI progressed to an unstageable pressure sore and she was re-admitted to UHL on 03.01.23 with sepsis from pneumonia and from the sacral pressure sore which had become infected and had progressed to osteomyelitis. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: equipment + respect + needs + layout, environment + patient + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - In respect of the D2A service (LGT and LBL): (1) The ‘discharge passport' completed by the UHL in-patient team was inaccurate, failing to record Ms Suleyman's vulnerability to pressure ulcers, the need for therapies input from day 1, the equipment she required and that her home environment had not been optimised to meet her needs both in terms of equipment and layout.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: care + needs + care + care + team">Whilst I heard that scrutiny of the discharge passport had improved at ward level, deficient discharge passports were still filtering through to the D2A team. (2) The deficiencies in the discharge passport were not identified when it was screened by the LGT Hospital Flow Centre. (3) On the day of discharge, Ms Suleyman should have received a welfare check from the LBL out of hours social worker which did not happen. (4) Due to lack of capacity, Ms Suleyman's interim care needs pending assessment were brokered to a care provider.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: care + needs + care + care + team">As a result, she did not receive a visit from a social worker and/or occupational therapist within 24 hours of discharge as she would have done if her care needs had been provided by the in-house Enablement team.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: respect + team">In respect of the involvement of the District Nursing Service (LGT) (1) The referral to the District Nursing team was incorrect in that it wrongly referred to Mrs Suleyman having a sacral DTI on discharge.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">This led the District Nursing team to believe that she was already on the caseload of the community TVN team.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: communication + between + between + team">This resulted in a delay in her being assessed by them. (2) There was little communication between the therapists from the D2A team and the District Nurses.</span> As a consequence of these deficiencies there were missed opportunities to recognise that Ms Suleyman's discharge was unsafe and act upon that. The issues relating to LBL only emerged in evidence during the inquest. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: fragmented">However, there has been a fragmented and incomplete response.</span> There has been no overarching coordinated investigation involving all the key services relevant to what is intended to be an integrated multi-disciplinary discharge process. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust and London Borough of Lambeth have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26 March 2025.

This report is being sent to: Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Alan Wilson, senior coroner for the coroner area of Blackpool & Fylde. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The conclusion of the inquest was that Brian died of natural causes. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The medical cause of his death was: 1 a Acute circulatory failure 1 b Coronary heart disease, congestive cardiomyopathy and bronchopneumonia complicated by haemorrhagic lung infarct 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In paragraph 3 of the Record of Inquest, I recorded as follows: Brian Kneale was aged 70 years.</span> Reportedly unwell for over a week with evidence of vomiting episodes and worsening shortness of breath, he attended hospital in Blackpool at approximately 3 pm on 27th June 2024. After assessment, concerns were raised he had developed aspiration pneumonia and heart failure. He was placed on the sepsis pathway but did not receive antibiotic therapy until the early hours of the following day. He was felt to be dehydrated and intravenous antibiotics were administered. From the available evidence, the quantity of fluids given is unclear, although by the afternoon of 28th June 2024 a portable chest x-ray revealed signs of fluid overload. Given that Brian had heart failure, a kidney injury and was showing signs of infection, the amount of fluids given probably contributed to worsening heart failure. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Reviewed by an Intensive Treatment Unit doctor, his prognosis was felt to be poor, and Brain died at 21.45 hours on 29th June 2024 in the presence of his family.</span> A subsequent post mortem examination confirmed he died from the combined effects of heart failure and bronchopneumonia. The following is of note: · Upon assessment after arrival at hospital, concerns were raised that Brian was in heart failure. · During the course of the investigation, his family have raised concerns about the extent of fluids administered during his hospital admission, which had contributed to worsening heart failure. · Having heard the available evidence, I was in agreement this was probably the case, particularly given that Brian had shown signs of acute kidney injury, and infection. · Bearing in mind the amount of fluids to be administered in this case required an element of caution, the fluid balance charts had not been recorded appropriately. They did not provide a reliable picture. · I received helpful evidence from a Consultant in Acute Medicine, who explained that during the Autumn of 2024 he had carried out a piece of work with the aim of improving how fluid balances are monitored and recorded for patients in the Emergency Department, but also the Acute Medical Unit. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: decisions + care, clear + care + monitoring + patient">Notwithstanding he had not worked at the hospital since October 2024, he felt some improvements had been made, but he remained concerned about the position in the Emergency Department, which remained challenging. · I was left with the impression that clinicians were at times having to make difficult judgements in the interests of patients when they did not have a clear picture about fluid balances. · Whether a hospital patient has been given an appropriate amount of fluids is a vital element of a patient's care, and when this does not happen effectively for whatever reason, it can understandably cause bereaved relatives significant concern. · I have a concern that although it seems the hospital Trust is aware there is an issue regarding accurate fluid balance monitoring, the current position is patients remain at risk if decisions may have to be made by clinicians in the absence of accurate fluid balance charts. · This issue can also have an impact upon reviews conducted internally by a hospital trust, and the extent to which these can be relied upon.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. Fluid balances are not being monitored as effectively as they ought to be; 2. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring

Keywords: information">Inaccurate recording of fluid balances can leave the authors of internal hospital reviews without the information they require to ensure the correct lessons are learned. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22 nd March 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes contributed to by Neglect. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Disability (e.g., hearing problems) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

He was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary at 12 January 2022 and sadly died mid-morning at 13 January 2022. Mr Lodge was being treated for dehydration and died of bilateral pneumonia. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

Keywords: concerns">Mr Lodge was, instead, transferred to the acute admissions unit, was not medically assessed again and he later suffered a cardiac arrest and died hours later. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Pain is not accurately assessed in people who are unable to communicate with words. The court heard evidence that Mr Lodge at no point was provided pain relief, despite requests from the attending family member who was speaking on his behalf. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">An independent expert, a Consultant in Emergency Medicine, gave evidence that there was no evidence of reasonable adjustments in respect of assessing Mr Lodge's pain to account for his baseline condition. (2) Basic examinations, including chest examinations, are not being carried out for learning disabled adults at risk of pneumonia in the emergency department.</span> The treating physicians in evidence agreed that there should have been a high index of suspicion of pneumonia in Mr Lodge's case and that it is one of the leading causes of death for people with learning disabilities. The court heard evidence that Mr Lodge did not have a chest examination carried out on him due to him not presenting any signs of respiratory distress. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The independent expert gave evidence that a thorough examination should have been undertaken and that there was the opportunity to do so after the sedation medication was given. (3) NEWS2 scores above seven are not appropriately escalated for specialist advice.</span> Clinical recommendations for 30 minute observations were not being followed. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + patient">An independent expert, a Consultant in Intensive Care, gave evidence to the court that Mr Lodge should have been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Hull Royal Infirmary at which Mr Lodge would have undergone closer examinations on a lower patient to nurse ratio. (4) Opportunities for learning from serious incidents are being lost.</span> No internal investigation or other form of serious incident investigation was undertaken. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Disability (e.g., hearing problems)
Keywords: review + disability">The court heard evidence from independent experts who opined that it would be expected, following a death in these circumstances, for there to have been an internal review to consider improvements to include input from a specialist with a learning disability team. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 February 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: the family of David Christopher Peter Lodge. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

General Chiropractic Council 1 CORONER I am Leila Benyounes, Assistant Coroner for the coronial area of Gateshead and South Tyneside 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26/10/21 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joanna Daria Kowalczyk. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22/05/25. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The conclusion of the inquest was: Joanna Kowalczyk died due to a combination of the consequences of chiropractic treatment following a naturally occurring medical event, on a background of an undiagnosed medical condition.</span> The medical cause of death was: 1a) Bronchopneumonia 1b) Cerebella infarction 1c) Bilateral vertebral artery dissection 2) Unspecified connective tissue disorder (undiagnosed) 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The Deceased had a medical history which included migraine and joint hypermobility. It is likely that the Deceased had an unspecified connective tissue disorder which had not been diagnosed, and which made her susceptible to arterial dissections. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: equipment + training">On 26/09/21 the Deceased underwent a personal training session at a gym when she felt a crack to her neck whilst using a piece of gym equipment and developed a severe headache.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">It is likely that she sustained bilateral arterial dissections at this time.</span> The Deceased attended the Emergency Department at hospital on 27/09/21 and there was clinical suspicion of a subarachnoid haemorrhage, so a CT scan of the head was undertaken. The scan did not identify a subarachnoid haemorrhage, and a lumbar puncture with admission to hospital was recommended to exclude this diagnosis, but the Deceased self-discharged prior to undergoing the lumbar puncture. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: assessment">On 28/09/21 the Deceased attended an initial appointment with a chiropractor with a complaint of neck pain, where an assessment was undertaken, and she was diagnosed with acute severe cervical facet dysfunction and associated muscle dysfunction.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Treatment in the form of adjustments and manipulation was recommended which the Deceased consented to.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">The Deceased informed the chiropractor that she had attended hospital and had undergone a CT scan and further investigations were advised, but she had self- discharged, and stated that the doctor was aware she was coming to see a chiropractor.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The chiropractor did not obtain any medical records prior to carrying out treatment.</span> The Deceased underwent the first adjustment and manipulation chiropractic session on 28/09/21 after which she felt some improvement in her neck pain. The Deceased underwent three further sessions with the chiropractor on 02/10/21, 09/10/21 and 16/10/21. During the fourth chiropractic session on 16/10/21, after the left adjustment to the neck, the Deceased experienced immediate symptoms of dizziness and room spinning. She developed double vision, tingling in her right hand and right foot, and was struggling to speak. The Deceased vomited whilst at the clinic. It is likely that the Deceased sustained acute dissections in the same location as the previous dissections during the chiropractic manipulation. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The chiropractor had initial concerns that the Deceased was suffering from a stroke so performed a FAST test which was negative.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The Deceased's symptoms began to improve, and she mobilised to a sofa in the treatment room to rest while the chiropractor sought a second opinion from a colleague.</span> The Deceased remained in the chiropractic clinic for some hours resting. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">During that time, she was advised to seek medical attention at hospital by both chiropractors, but she did not wish to attend.</span> An ambulance was not called by either chiropractor in reliance on the improvement in the Deceased's symptoms. The Deceased was unable to walk properly as she left the chiropractic clinic and required assistance from her partner. The chiropractor prepared a handwritten note advising the Deceased to go to A&E if any signs appeared. Those were the signs of stroke from the NHS website. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">As a result of speech difficulty reported during an emergency call, paramedics attended via blue light ambulance later that day and carried out an assessment of the Deceased, including a FAST test due to possible symptoms of stroke, which was negative.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The attending paramedic was reassured by a telephone conversation with the treating chiropractor that symptoms of dizziness and migraine were normal after the chiropractic treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The attending paramedic was not aware that symptoms of stroke could stop after a short period of time and assessed the Deceased based on the Deceased's reported symptoms at that time.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">A diagnosis of migraine was reached by the paramedic from the reported history, the examination findings, and in reliance on the chiropractor's reassurance that the chiropractor had no concerns, with a recording of a pain score of 6/10.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">An information for healthcare professionals document was completed by the paramedic before leaving the scene which recorded dizziness symptoms and the Deceased could not open her right eye for a while.</span> Like the previous day, the Deceased was unable to mobilise unaided and required assistance to mobilise from her partner, which was not observed or recorded by the attending paramedic. Had the paramedic observed and recorded the inability to mobilise unaided, the Deceased would have been assessed as FAST positive and transported to hospital on 16/10/21. On 17/10/21 paramedics attended the Deceased again via blue light ambulance at the highest priority. It was identified that the Deceased was gravely unwell with a reduced level of consciousness, and a FAST test to exclude stroke, could not be performed. A decision was made to transfer to the Emergency Department. The Deceased was unable to mobilise and required the use of a chair to be transported to the ambulance. The Deceased deteriorated in the ambulance on the way to hospital and required intubation and ventilation. A CT scan identified a maturing infarction involving the near entirety of the posterior fossa structures and a CT angiogram identified left vertebral artery dissection. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Specialist advice was sought, and no treatment was available.</span> The Deceased deteriorated and brain stem testing confirmed death at 13.10 on 19/10/21 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: treatment + attendance">Whilst it is possible that investigations undertaken on 16/10/21 either after attendance at hospital following the chiropractic treatment or following the attendance by paramedics, may have identified the dissection to one of the arteries which was subsequently identified on 17/10/21, this cannot be determined to the requisite standard of proof.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">It is not possible to determine whether earlier identification of the dissection on 16/10/21 would have allowed different management and treatment, so as to have changed the tragic outcome.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: concerns + contribute">An investigation undertaken by the ambulance service found that there was a failure in communications made by the paramedic crew on 17/10/21, but this did not cause or contribute to the death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: guidance + time + guidance + training">The evidence from the attending paramedic was that she was not aware that symptoms of a stroke can stop after a short time as clearly set out on NHS website and guidance, and that this was not part of her training.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

Keywords: treatment + informed + assessment + attendance">The evidence on behalf of the treating chiropractor was that he did not consider it necessary to request GP records or hospital records, before assessment or treatment despite being informed about the Deceased's recent hospital attendance, investigation which was recommended, and her discharge against medical advice.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: treatment + consent + assessment">Even in the updated consent form I have been provided with, which was designed by the British Chiropractic Association, there is no prompt or question designed for the chiropractor to ask to consider obtaining medical records before assessment or treatment, and when this may be appropriate, and the only reference to medical records is a consent to communicate as deemed necessary for the treatment, and for a report to be sent to the GP after treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: treatment + assessment">I am concerned that consideration to obtaining medical records should always be given before assessment, particularly where recent medical treatment or investigations has been undertaken. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25 April 2024.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period.

This report is being sent to: The British Orthopaedic Association | Stryker (UK) Ltd
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The British Orthopaedic Association Managing Director of Stryker (UK) Ltd 1 CORONER I am Richard T Middleton, Assistant Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Dorset 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 14 th December 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Reginal Victor Smith, born on the 11 th June 1933. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 10 th January 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The Medical Cause of Death was: 1a Hypovolemic Shock 1b Re operation of fractured neck of femur 1c Fractured neck of femur II The conclusion of the Inquest recorded that Reginald Victor Smith died as a consequence of a rare but recognised complication of a surgical procedure. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 9/10/23 Mr Smith had a witnessed fall at his care home.</span> He was admitted to Poole Hospital where he underwent surgery to repair a right extra capsular neck of femur fracture on 12/10/23. The surgery involved Mr Smith being laid on a traction table and a jig was used to align the fracture for screws to be inserted into a titanium nail which is placed into the femur. On 24/10/23 he was discharged from hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">On 5/12/23 he attended Poole Hospital for a review appointment when X rays disclosed a failure of metalwork inserted on 12/10/23 and he was readmitted to hospital.</span> On 7/12/23 Mr Smith underwent revision surgery. It was apparent that the hip screw was slightly off centre and being approximately 1mm-2mm off centre did not make proper contact with the nail. Following surgery his health deteriorated. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: concerns + care + care + care">Mr Smith received palliative care and he died in hospital on 7/12/23. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) During the inquest evidence was heard that: i) Evidence was given to suggest there were two probable reasons for the hip screw not correctly passing into the nail: firstly, before the femoral nail and jig were inserted it may be that the jig was loose and needed tightening or secondly, the jig used might have been slightly bent 2) I have concerns with regard to the following: i) Each jig is used many times in surgery having been sterilised after each procedure.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: analysis + quality + information + time">It is hammered into the thigh bone and on this occasion may have become deformed over time. ii) The jig was sent away to the manufacturer for analysis but was lost and so no information was available to the court in relation to its integrity. iii) There is no quality control in place in relation to the examination of the jigs being used (other than when it is assembled in theatre by a nurse) prior to surgery.</span> There is no auditing/ spot checks in relation to the integrity of the jigs. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, by 18 th March 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Mr Smith's Family I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Vauna Leeming
Coroners name: David Reid
Coroners Area: Worcestershire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, Charles Hastings Way, Worcester WR5 1DD; 1 CORONER I am David Donald William REID, HM Senior Coroner for Worcestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 April 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Vauna LEEMING. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs. Leeming "died from natural causes, to which a recent fractured neck of femur and surgical repair thereof contributed" . 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In answer to the questions "when, where and how did Mrs. Leeming come by her death?", I recorded as follows: "On 6.2.24 Vauna Leeming was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital after suffering an accidental fall at home, and was found to have sustained a fractured right neck of femur. She underwent surgery to repair the fracture on 8.2.24, from which she initially made a satisfactory recovery. However, on 23.3.24 her condition deteriorated, and she tested positive for Covid-19. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: treatment + concerns">She went on to suffer a pulmonary embolism and, despite treatment, declined and died in hospital on 25.3.24." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1) Following Mrs. Leeming's surgery on 8.2.24, measures were put in place to prevent the formation of a deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

This report is being sent to: Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive of the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board 1 CORONER I am David Regan, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of South Wales Central. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST A Coronial investigation was commenced on 20 th April 2022 into the death of Jackson Yeow, aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 15 th -16 th January 2025. The conclusion was a narrative conclusion and the medical cause of death was 1 (a) cerebral oedema, 1(b) diabetic ketoacidosis; 2 recent covid 19 infection; pancreatitis 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH These were recorded as: - Jackson Yeow, aged 16 years, suffered autistic spectrum disorder and obesity. On 28 th March 2022 he was assessed by a general practitioner following a history of abdominal pain and vomiting, diagnosed with suspected gastritis, and treated. On 4 th April 2022 his mother became concerned that his symptoms had worsened and sought the assistance of the general practice by telephone. Jackson was unable to mobilise to attend GP consultation in person and his mother phoned 999 at 12.13. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: resource">Despite subsequent clinical support desk review and further 999 calls, an ambulance service resource was not allocated until after Jackson became unconscious at about 19.30, attending at 20.00.</span> Jackson was subject to a prolonged extrication from his house with fire service and EMERTS assistance, was intubated and taken to the University Hospital of Wales where he was diagnosed to be suffering diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, cerebral oedema, renal compromise and severe acidosis. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Despite intensive treatment over the subsequent days his condition deteriorated and he died on 9 th April 2022.</span> The narrative conclusion which I returned was: Jackson Yeow, aged 16, died of diabetic ketoacidosis following a wait for an ambulance of approximately 9 1⁄2 hours. The Inquest focused upon: - a. The fact that Jackson Yeow's condition deteriorated on 4 th April 2022. His family contacted his GP and was offered a face to face appointment which he became physically unable to attend. b. His family telephoned 999 at 12.13 on 4 th April 2022. c. The ambulance service categorised the call as an amber 1 response, which it characterised as a life threatening call requiring an urgent response. d. The evidence of the ambulance service was that its ability to respond to the call was substantially impaired by the fact that a significant number of its resources were delayed at hospitals awaiting hand over of patients. e. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

(4) The underling obstacle to improving flow through the hospital and relieving pressure on the Emergency Department is the significant number of patients who are medically fit to be discharged but whose discharge is delayed due to non medical reasons. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 th March 2025.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] - The Chief Executive of East Suffolk and North Essex Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Daniel SHARPSTONE, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Suffolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26th February 2024 I opened an Inquest into the death of: Denise Ellen Johnson The conclusion of the Inquest on 10 th December 2024 was: Dee died from acute small and large bowel infarction secondary to necrotising pancreatitis and intraabdominal sepsis, both recognised complications of severe post ERCP pancreatitis, on the background of obesity, recent treatment for breast Cancer and severe psychological stress The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Multi-organ failure 1b Severe E.coli septicemia 1c Pancreatic necrosis and ischemic bowel perforation 1d CBD stones and post ERCP pancreatitis 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Dee was admitted to hospital as an emergency with abdominal pain and jaundice on 13 th August 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Dee was 42 years of age with a history of obesity, ongoing treatment for breast cancer and depression.</span> Investigations revealed a gallstone in the common bile duct as the cause of her jaundice. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed and a plastic stent inserted for drainage. Dee became acutely unwell post ERCP and was diagnosed with acute necrotising pancreatitis. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Keywords: treatment + care + guidance + care + guidance + team">The care of Dee's necrotising pancreatitis and associated peri-pancreatic collections via CT Scans, insertion of abdominal drains, treatment plans and clinical updates was managed at Ipswich General Hospital with ongoing advice and guidance from Addenbrooke's Hepato- Pancreato-Biliary multidisciplinary team.</span> Subsequent CT scanning showed severe pancreatitis with fat necrosis and peripancreatic fluid collections. Dee's infected peri-pancreatic collections were drained by a series of drains. Dee had regular pain management, physiotherapy and dietician review. The peripancreatic collections were managed by ongoing abdominal drainage, flushing and antibiotics as guided by Microbiology. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: concerns + care + care">Despite ITU admission with intensive supportive care her condition deteriorated and Dee died on 24 th November 2022. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In these circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you: MATTERS OF CONCERN Timely notification to ERCP practitioners following serious complications, with formal case review ERCP-based endoscopic complications should be presented in a formal setting in the presence of Endoscopy colleagues. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">There is a need for timely feedback to responsible ERCP practitioners in cases of procedure-based complications to ensure checks and learning on matters such as safety and adherence to guidelines and standard practice.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: treatment + communication + issues">Regular discussions about management plans and treatment options with NOK/family by a responsible Surgical Consultant for inpatients with serious chronic surgical issues Plans and management were discussed on the Surgical ward with Dee by the Consultant but there was a paucity of comprehensible and timely communication with the next of kin and rest of the family concerning management plans and treatment options.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: safety + situation">Two-way feedback in this situation plays a vital role in maintaining patient wellbeing and safety.</span> Lack of clarity around named Surgical Consultant cover for unexpected leave It was unclear who was the Surgical Consultant responsible for Dee and her pancreatic disease management when her usual Consultant was off work due to unexpected leave. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: treatment + care, clear + care + between">A clear handover process at Consultant Surgeon level for unexpected leave enables continuation of care between health care professionals and teams with continuity and oversight of treatment and management plans.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: safety + treatment + issues">Accordingly, I consider that: Not having timely notification to ERCP practitioners following serious procedure- based complications, and timely associated formal ERCP case review with endoscopy colleagues Not having regular explanations and discussions with NOK/family by the responsible Consultant concerning ongoing management plans and treatment options for inpatients with serious surgical issues and, Lack of clarity over named Surgical Consultant cover with responsibility for surgical inpatients during periods of unexpected leave All pose a significant risk to patient safety. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths as detailed above, and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take any such action you identify. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 21, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. Dee's next of kin. I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the Senior Coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 30/12/2024 Daniel SHARPSTONE Assistant Coroner for Suffolk

The conclusion of the inquest was: Aarav died from the consequences of a cardiac arrest caused by severe bleeding following damage to an intercostal artery during a liver biopsy which went undiagnosed and untreated at the time of the procedure. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: medication + treatment + communication + planning">His death was contributed to by poor planning before the procedure when there was no consideration of stopping antiplatelet medication, poor written and oral communication about the complication that occurred during the procedure all of which hampered treatment after his collapse.</span> His death was contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Aarav was born with biliary atresia which meant the bile flow out of his liver was blocked. Due to this a Kasai portoenterostomy was undertaken on 26/10/20 to bypass the blockage and ensure the bile drained into the intestine. In February 2023 he presented with fever and worsening jaundice and was treated as an inpatient for cholangitis and worsening liver failure. He was placed on the transplant list in April 2023 and received a transplant on 15/08/23. Post transplant he developed hepatic artery thrombosis, which is a recognised complication of liver transplant, requiring further surgery to reconstruct the blood flow for the liver and bile ducts. The bile ducts were found to have been damaged by this complication. He was placed on dual antiplatelet therapy to try to avoid any further similar complications. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The effect of antiplatelet medication is to impede the ability of the blood to clot effectively.</span> Aarav went on to develop rejection of the graft liver and was found to have severe stenosis of the reconstructed bile ducts and had drains inserted. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The rejection was treated, and he was able to go home on 23/10/23 on immunosuppressant medication to return for further tests a short time later.</span> He was admitted on 20/11/23 for those further tests which included a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC), a liver biopsy and removal of a vas catheter line which were all undertaken on 21/11/23. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Prior to the procedure no consideration was given to stopping his dual antiplatelet therapy which should have been stopped a week before and the clinicians involved in the procedure were unaware he was on antiplatelet medication.</span> The PTC proceeded without problem. The first attempt at the liver biopsy was undertaken by a trainee who placed a coaxial needle into the 7th intercostal space. The needle could not be seen on imaging and was withdrawn. It was not appreciated at the time that the needle did not follow the correct pathway which damaged an intercostal artery which started to bleed. A second attempt was made in the 8th intercostal space, and a liver biopsy was obtained. A vas catheter was removed. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">A fluoroscopy undertaken at the end of the procedure at 12.10 identified blood in the pleural space (haemothorax) but this was not identified as significant at the time and was not treated or communicated to other staff caring for Aarav.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: concerns + record">The operation record did not record that 2 attempts were made to obtain a liver biopsy nor that there were any concerns about a haemothorax.</span> In recovery Aarav was agitated and 2 out of 4 blood pressures could not be recorded. He returned to the ward at 12.50 after 20 minutes in recovery and only 1 blood pressure could be recorded at 13.15 which was low and at the same time he had a high heart rate. Aarav continued to be agitated and cold and it was not appreciated that he needed further review. Aarav went into cardiac arrest at 13.30 and received resuscitation for 28 minutes before being moved to PICU for stabilisation. An US at 14.00 confirmed a large haemothorax however a chest drain was not inserted at this time. There was no joined up discussion about how to best treat Aarav and it was unclear who was leading decision making for the complication that had occurred. Aarav was taken back to the interventional radiology theatre at around 16.30/17.00 where they identified a puncture of the intercostal artery which was embolised and a chest drain was inserted. On return to PICU it was confirmed that sadly Aarav had suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the prolonged arrest and he passed away on 22/11/23. Had the haemothorax been addressed at the time of the procedure Aarav would likely have been monitored and treated before the cardiac arrest. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. Prophylactic antibiotics for severely immunocompromised patients : The inquest heard evidence that patients like Aarav who are immunocompromised require additional prophylactic antibiotics for procedures. This is not covered in the current NICE guidelines. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">My concern is that there is currently no guidance for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in severely immunocompromised patients. 2.</span> Experience and competence of trainees : The inquest heard evidence that there was confusion around the experience and level of the trainee involved. He was thought to be an ST6 when he was an ST4. My concern is that there is no mechanism to evidence trainees experience and competence when they travel to various different hospital trusts as part of their training. 3. Consent forms : The parents of Aarav were unaware that a trainee would be doing the liver biopsy. My concern is that there is currently no way to obtain consent when a trainee will be doing the procedure. 4. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: factors + patient">Individual patient risk factors : Aarav had a complex medical background and several risk factors for any procedure.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + factors + care + patient">My concern is that there is currently no mechanism to identify individual patient's risk factors so that all clinicians involved in their care are aware. 5.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: inadequate">Learning from deaths: The initial M&M meeting after Aarav's death was described as inadequate.</span> My concern is that there was no immediate learning from this tragedy and further consideration is needed to ensure a safe and effective mechanism to properly learn from deaths at the earliest opportunity. 6. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + patient">Electronic patient records: I heard evidence that the lack of electric medical records meant clinicians found it difficult to see all of the patient's medication details.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: access, treatment + information + planning">My concern is that critical information can be missed if clinicians do not have access to all the clinical records when planning treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 March 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Aarav's parents and to the LOCAL SAFEGUARDING BOARD.</span> I have also sent it to the Medical Examiner, ICS, NHS England, CQC, who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 13 January 2025 Signature: Louise Hunt Senior Coroner for Birmingham and Solihull

[REDACTED] Chief Executive, NHS England, Quarry House, Quarry Hill, Leeds, LS2 7UE via email [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Lisa Milner, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex, Brighton and Hove. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Morgan Rose Betchley, formerly Sladovic, aged 19 years. The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 22 nd November 2024. The conclusion given by the jury was a narrative conclusion namely: Morgan died as a result of her own actions. Historical evidence suggests that in all probability Morgan's intent had been to self-harm as a cry for help and that it was not her intention to end her life. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + risk, assessment + staff + guidance">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- There is no policy or guidance to staff for the assessment of risk posed by fixtures and fittings supplied by the Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + risk">There is therefore the risk that fixtures and fittings supplied and/or not removed by the Trust from patients, who are suffering from acute mental health, are at risk of utilising these items to take their own life. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 th February 2025 I, the coroner, may extend the period.</span> Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: NHS England | Royal College of Radiologists
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 NHS England 2 The Royal College of Radiologists 1 CORONER I am Steve ECCLESTON, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Yorkshire Western Coroner Area 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 27.03.24 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gemma Suzanne Marshall (Female) (DoB 27.07.22) aged 46. Ms Marshall died on 15.03.24 at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18.12.24. The conclusion of the inquest was in narrative form: Gemma Marshall died on 15.03.24 at the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary from the consequences of her gastric band slipping and causing her stomach to twist and suffer a haemorrhagic infarction. The infarction caused a build-up of blood-stained fluid in her peritoneum which stimulated her vagus nerve which then caused an arrhythmia in her heart. She then collapsed in the shower and could not be resuscitated. An outsourced CT scan failed to advise that the gastric band had slipped and this contributed to a failure to refer Gemma to bariatric specialists who could have intervened such that she might have lived. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

She collapsed in the shower in hospital on 15.03.24 and did not recover. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_External - Economic factor + I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_External - Societal factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Escalation/referral factor (including fresh eyes reviews) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Evidence was given by the consultant surgeon who fitted the band, a senior bariatric surgeon at the treating hospital and a consultant radiologist at the treating hospital that the gastric band had slipped. A CT scan was undertaken on 13.03.24 and reported on by a radiologist with expertise in musculoskeletal imaging (rather than gastric or abdominal imaging) who worked for an outsourced company. This was because of staff shortages in the hospital. The scan report mentioned the existence of the band but didn't comment on the fact that the images clearly showed the band was out of position. That is that the stomach had slipped and had formed a pouch above the band. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">This was, in my view, a critical failure in the care Ms Marshall received.</span> Had this image been correctly reported, then a referral to bariatric surgeons would have probably been made which might have meant she would have survived. Evidence from the consultant radiologist and the consultant surgeon in the hospital was that this failure to report that the band had slipped was because of a lack of familiarity in radiologists as to how slipped bands present, something which was compounded by 1. The increasing rarity of the procedure, 2. The consequences of specialisms which are not familiar with the abdomen or bariatric issues and 3. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: staff shortage">A need to sometimes rely on outsourced third-party radiologists without the relevant specialism because of staff shortage.</span> While the hospital had taken steps to address this knowledge gap, there remained a concern that this lack of knowledge as to how slipped bands present was an issue of concern across the country and that other patients could face similar failures to Marshall. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 17, 2025.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [ REDACTED]. Chief Executive, Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust 1 CORONER I am Guy Davies, His Majesty's Assistant Coroner for Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. [HYPERLINKS] 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of 69-year-old Michael Ramon Jervis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 October 2024. The medical cause of death was found to be 1a Neutropenic Sepsis 1b Chemotherapy II Germ Cell Testicular Cancer The four questions - who, when, where and how - were answered as follows ... <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Michael Ramon JERVIS died on 16 July 2023 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro from Neutropenic Sepsis, a recognized complication of chemotherapy treatment for Testicular Cancer.</span> There was a 20-hour delay in the administration of antibiotics from the point at which clinical observations repeatedly indicated that antibiotics were clearly required. This delay in the administration of antibiotics more than minimally contributed to his death . The conclusion as to the death is ... <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Michael Ramon JERVIS died from a recognized complication of necessary medical treatment contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 1.</span> Mike was diagnosed with testicular cancer in May 2023 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (RCHT). The cancer was treatable. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The treatment plan was four cycles of chemotherapy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The aim of treatment was curative.</span> Prior to the cancer diagnosis Mike was an independent, fit, and active man. 2. Mike underwent three cycles of chemotherapy. The cancer responded well to chemotherapy with the tumour markers falling from 18,000 to 18 by 5 July 2023. 3. Mike was discharged home on 9 July 2023 with a plan to admit him for the fourth round of chemotherapy. 4. However, Mike was re-admitted on 13 July 2023 to RCHT after becoming unwell. Bloods were taken on admission which revealed neutropenia. This is a condition which involves a significant weakening of the immune system and indicated a high risk of sepsis. 5. At 1600 hours 13 July 2023, an acute oncology nurse specialist recorded on Mike's notes that antibiotics should be administered should Mike's temperature fall below 36 or rise above 37.5. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: treatment">The court found that infections and sepsis are a recognized complication of chemotherapy because the treatment leaves patients immuno- compromised. 7.</span> The court heard that a bundle of six measures are required when clinical indicators of sepsis are present, known as the ‘Sepsis Six' bundle. The indicators for implementation of sepsis six, particularly for those immuno-compromised, include temperature above 37.5, below 36. 8. The six measures include administering fluids and administering antibiotics. The court found that of the six measures, antibiotics is the most important and should be administered within 60 minutes. 9. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: policy + staff + staff">The court heard that the Sepsis Six bundle has been policy since 2006 at RCHT and nursing staff and doctors are expected to be aware of and implement sepsis six when indicated. 10.</span> The first indication that sepsis six should be implemented was at 1710 hours on 13 July 2023 when observations gave a NEWS score of 4 in which low temperature (temp 35.6) and low blood pressure (78/42) should have resulted in a medical review and met the low threshold for IV antibiotics. 11. Thereafter numerous observations were taken over the following hours indicating that Mike met the low threshold for IV antibiotics. 12.

This report is being sent to: Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive Officer of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Rebecca Mundy, HM Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Essex. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 February 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Charles Hare (Bill), 71. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 3 December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion outlining that Mr Hare had died from metastatic urothelial cancer, contributed to by neglect, namely delays to diagnosis and treatment resulting in the cancer spreading to such an extent any treatment that could have been given, became futile. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Bill presented to Basildon Hospital in November 2022 with abdominal and left loin pain.</span> Following CT scans and discussion at a Multi‐Disciplinary Team (MDT) meeting, it was suspected that Bill had cancer in the middle‐left ureter. The MDT determined that an MRI and CT chest be carried out as well as a consultation with Bill. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The MRI showed no obvious urothelial lesions and so the advice was that if concerns remained, a ureteroscopy was recommended.</span> Following a consultation with Bill on 4 January 2023 a ureteroscopy was requested. This was undertaken on 16 February. The results of the biopsy were available on 7 March but were inconclusive. The MDT considered next steps on 21 March and advised that imaging and biopsy be repeated with a view to a nephroureterectomy being undertaken. A telephone consultation took place with Bill on 27 March and he was referred to a Consultant Urological Surgeon. Bill was not seen until 23 May. The Consultant adopted the plan set by the MDT, although he felt that Bill would ultimately require surgical intervention. A CT scan was repeated on 5 June but it wasn't until 29 August that Bill's case and ongoing plan was next reviewed by the MDT. No one giving evidence could explain that delay. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">Bill attended a pre‐assessment clinic on 4 September, but due to an elevated HBA1c of 104 he was deemed unfit for surgery and instructions were given that he was to be seen in the Diabetic Clinic and re‐referred when his HBA1c was below 70.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: poorly">In the meantime, Bill presented to Basildon hospital again on 3 October with hyponatremia secondary to diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia secondary to poorly controlled diabetes.</span> His left kidney showed very poor function. There was no evidence of bone metastasis. He was discharged on 25 October. However, he presented again on 17 November with low sodium and sepsis with a left nephrostomy tube. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Further scans and investigations were undertaken but no positive action was taken in progressing Bill's diagnosis or treatment plan.</span> By the time an MRI was undertaken on 20 December, there was evidence of disease progression. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Bill was due to be moved to Southend Hospital for specialist treatment by the renal team during this admission, however, due to a combination of a lack of beds, ward closures, junior doctor strikes, a full ITU and issues with transport, he remained in Basildon until 3 January 2024.</span> By this time, his cancer had metastasised to his bladder and psoas muscle. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: spread">A further CT scan, the results of which only became available on 15 January, revealed that it has also spread to his lungs.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - i. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">There was an overall delay in reaching any diagnosis in Bill's case and, therefore, any treatment plan being implemented. ii.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: national">There was a delay in the first biopsy being taken which ultimately took place well outside the national guideline of 31 days. iii.</span> There was a delay from the MDT referring the case to the Consultant, to an appointment taking place in May 2023. iv. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + between + between">There was an additional delay between the further CT scan ordered by the Consultant, which took place on 5 June, and the MDT which considered the results and treatment plan on 29 August, notwithstanding the fact that the MDT meet weekly and Bill's case could have been considered at any of those meetings. v.</span> A further delay occurred from 4 September, as Bill had been assessed as unfit for surgery due to his HBA1c reading. Whilst this is unlikely to have been related to the cancer, there was likely to have been an opportunity, had his case been progressed earlier, at which his HBA1c was at an acceptable level for the procedure to be carried out. vi. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + between + between">In his last admission to Basildon Hospital between November 2023 and January 2024 there were delays in progressing his treatment due to the disjointed nature of the inter‐relationship between Basildon and Southend Hospitals as well as delays in transporting him to Southend Hospital which included failures to organise transport and properly coordinate his transfer. vii.</span> A final delay occurred in the results of a CT scan, the results of which were not available until 15 January. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: spread">By this time, the cancer had spread throughout Bill's body and became untreatable. viii.</span> Among the delays, and potentially contributing to them, were a series of systemic and procedural errors largely related to processes controlled by isolated computer systems or people who are not medically trained. One example is the default of a referral or request to "routine". ix. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + between + between">The lack of a specialist renal consultant at the MDT and lack of effective interaction between the people and systems at Southend and Basildon Hospitals prevented quick and effective decision making and, therefore, progress of Bill's diagnosis and treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 February 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Bill's family. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: quality + care + care + care">I have also sent it to The Care Quality Commission, who may find it useful or of interest.</span> Further, I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 23 December 2024 Rebecca MUNDY, HM Assistant Coroner

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: BCUHB, Ysbyty Gwynedd, Penrhosgarnedd, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 2PW. 1 CORONER I am John Adrian Gittins, Senior Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 14 th of June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Margaret Joy Daly (DOB 23.10.32 DOD 10.6.24). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 24 th of October 2024. The cause of death was recorded as being due to 1(a) Traumatic subdural haematoma (b) A fall 2. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">Delirium and the conclusion of the inquest was that the death was due to an accident. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are that Mrs Daly had been an in-patient at Wrexham Maelor Hospital and as a result of her being assessed as being at significant risk of falling she was on an enhanced level of observation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: review + staff + staff">On the evening of the 1 st of June 2024, Mrs Daly was exhibiting signs of anxiety and agitation and a member of nursing staff asked a doctor to review her.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">As the doctor was too busy to attend the ward, the nurse took Mrs Daly's prescription chart to the doctor on another ward and he prescribed a sedative, namely lorazepam which was administered to her at 22.40 that evening with a further dose being given at 04.30 the following day.</span> Later that morning Mrs Daly had an unwitnessed fall and sustained the injury which resulted in her death. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The evidence supports a view that it is probable that she fell as a result of the effects of the sedation. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed the following matter giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: prescription + issues">The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. - The clinician who prescribed a sedative, did so, without reference to any of Mrs Daly's notes other than her prescription chart and as a result was unaware of her enhanced falls risk or any other behavioural issues.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + access + review + patient">Whilst I recognise that medication changes may be necessary without the doctor being able to review a patient in person, I am concerned that this may occur without the doctor having access to and considering her full medical records and risk assessments. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 rd of December 2024 I, the coroner, may extend the period.</span> Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Family of the Deceased and to the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Ref: 2024-0696
Deceased name: Anne Leake
Coroners name: Duncan Ritchie
Coroners Area: Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] - Chairman of University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Duncan Ritchie, assistant coroner for the coroner area of Staffordshire & Stoke-on-Trent. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 13 th June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anne Patricia Leake, aged 67. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 th December 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hypoxic brain injury 1b Cardiac arrest 1c Ventricular arrhythmia The narrative conclusion was: Natural causes contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs Leake suffered arrhythmia and cardiac arrest on 17 th April 2024. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">She was admitted to the Royal Stoke University Hospital and a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) of doctors decided that she was to have heart valve surgery and have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) fitted before she was released from hospital.</span> The purpose of the ICD was to prevent Mrs Leake from suffering future cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. A few days later, Mrs Leake underwent heart valve surgery as planned, but she was then mistakenly released from hospital without having fitted the ICD which she needed. Three days after she was released from hospital Mrs Leake suffered a cardiac arrhythmia of the type which an ICD is designed to address, and she died as a result. I found that the failure to fit the ICD was causative of Mrs Leake's death and it amounted to neglect. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The decision of the MDT to fit the ICD was overlooked by the doctors who released Mrs Leake from hospital because the note of the MDT meeting which made this decision was not recorded on the medical notes which they were working from. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 NHS England 2 Chief Coroner 1 CORONER I am Helen RIMMER, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Liverpool and Wirral 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Eleanor Hazel ALDRED-OWEN aged 1. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: The conclusion of the inquest was that cause of death: 1a. Severe hypoxia ischaemic encephalopathy (with coning) 1b. Cardio respiratory arrest 1c. Right tension pneumothorax Conclusion: Misadventure contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Eleanor was admitted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital on 29 th September 2023 for elective craniofacial surgery. There was no associated problems or genetic abnormalities, and Eleanor was otherwise well. The procedure for bicoronal synostosis was uneventful except that Eleanor's tracheal tube dislodged towards the end of the procedure and she required reintubating. Eleanor returned to the ward following her surgery and was seemingly stable apart from being tachycardic. Over a period of several hours, she deteriorated with increased breathing and respiratory distress. At 22:35 hours Eleanor sustained a cardiac arrest and required full resuscitation over the course of 20 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Deceased name: Richard Roe
Coroners name: Simon Milburn
Coroners Area: Cambridgeshire & Peterborough
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: NORTH WEST ANGLIA NHS FOUNDATION TRUST
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. NORTH WEST ANGLIA NHS FOUNDATION TRUST 1 CORONER I am SIMON MILBURN, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Cambridgeshire & Peterborough 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 25 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Richard David ROE aged 75. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 October 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Mr Roe underwent a pulmonary angiogram at Hinchingbrook Hospital in Huntingdon on 26.09.21. This revealed a pancreatic cyst. A subsequent CT scan on 11.10.21 identified a lesion in excess of 3cm in the tail of the pancreas. The reporting radiologist recommended the scan be reviewed by the Hepato-Biliary MDT but the scan was neither actioned nor viewed. Had it been viewed the scan would have shown the presence of pancreatic cancer. Mr Roe re-presented to Hinchingbrook Hospital in November 2022 and a subsequent CT scan revealed the presence of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Sadly Mr Roe died at his home address, [REDACTED], at 0832hrs on 20.01.23. Had his pancreatic cancer been identified in October 2021 it is likely that Mr Roe would have undergone surgery and been treated with subsequent chemotherapy. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Although the chance of the treatment being curative was low had treatment been provided he would not have died as soon as 20.01.23. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Roe underwent an abdominal CT scan in October 2021.</span> This showed evidence of pancreatic cancer. The CT scan was the subject of a routine referral by the reporting radiologist due to the fact that an earlier pulmonary angiogram had identified a pancreatic cyst(so it was not flagged as an ‘unexpected finding'). The CT scan was not reviewed or actioned as requested by the radiologist. A subsequent CT scan conducted on 01.12.22 revealed that the pancreatic cancer had metastasised. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The evidence revealed that there is currently no method for ensuring that routine CT scan reports are reviewed by clinicians. This is despite a similar occurrence in May 2021. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues

I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: · Secretary of State for Health · NHS England 1 CORONER I am Penelope Schofield, Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex and Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 rd November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Zak Sheldrick (Matty).</span> Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them. The investigation concluded with the Inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 th December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">At the end of the Inquest, I concluded that: On 3rd November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health.</span> This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Later on 4th November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them.</span> Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished. However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear. The following issues contributed to their death:- 1. The fact that Matty's private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues. 2. The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between">They stayed in the Accident and Emergency department for 26 days during their admission between 5th and 30th September 2022.</span> This meant that there was no meaningful therapeutic input at that time. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment
Keywords: mental health + environment">The fact that Accident and Emergency Department was not a suitable environment for a neurodivergent individual and the 26-day period of their stay contributed to the deterioration of their mental health difficulties. 4.</span> The fact that there was a general lack of inpatient bed provision for informal patients and in particular for those who are autistic and non- binary who require to be on a mixed ward. 5. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: treatment + assessment">The fact that Matty was discharged from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team on 18th October 2022 before being picked up by Assessment and Treatment Service.</span> This left a gap in service provision for Matty. 6. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: access + care + care + care">The rigidity of the referral process to Transforming Care in Autism team (TCAT) meant that Matty was unable to access specialist advice and resources whilst in A&E or in the community. 7.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor
Keywords: mental health + communication + assessment + communication">The fact that the mental health assessment carried out during this second admission did not take into account the following:- - The views and observations of the nearest relative, Matty's mother. - Matty's preferred communication aids and in particular Matty's communication book. - The need for Matty to have an advocate present during the assessment and give consideration to the use of idiosyncratic language. - The extent of Matty's deteriorating mental state and their increasing risks in the context of their neurodivergence. - The fact that Matty's change of behaviour during the assessment may be due to:- a) the fact that Matty had been given diazepam b) the fact that Matty may have been able to mask their distress. - Too much emphasis was placed on Matty's presentation within the assessment itself. 8.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: mental health + patient">However, they had never been sectioned under the Mental Health Act or had spent time as a voluntary patient in a mental health hospital.</span> Matty had moved to Brighton from Surrey in November 2021 having wanted to live independently. He was drawn to Brighton as they wished to be involved in the trans/non-binary community. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Matty's mental health deteriorated during the summer of 2022 due to accommodation issues that they had been facing and issues with an online relationship.</span> By 3 rd September they were in crisis. On 5 th September 2022 Matty was admitted to A&E at the Royal County Hospital, Brighton. They remained within A&E, short stay ward, for 26 days awaiting a psychiatric bed. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

This report is being sent to: Sussex ICB
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive Integrated Care Board 1 CORONER I am Penelope Schofield, Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of West Sussex and Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 rd November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Zak Sheldrick (Matty).</span> Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them. The investigation concluded with the Inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 th December 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">At the end of the Inquest, I concluded that: On 3rd November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health.</span> This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Later on 4th November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them.</span> Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished. However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear. The following issues contributed to their death:- 1. The fact that Matty's private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues. 2. The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between">They stayed in the Accident and Emergency department for 26 days during their admission between 5th and 30th September 2022.</span> This meant that there was no meaningful therapeutic input at that time. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment

Keywords: mental health">The lack of inpatient beds leading to the unacceptable wait time in A&E for those suffering with their mental health who are awaiting beds.</span> In Matty's case a bed was not found for them within a 26-day period. 2. There being a shortage of beds for Autistic patients (both informal and detained) within the private sector that are being funded by the ICB. Evidence was heard that those providing beds within the public sector very often refused to accept autistic patients due to their additional risks. 3. There being a shortage of beds for transgender patients who are in need of a mixed ward. 4. In Matty's case it appears there was a lack of appreciation by the ICB of his extensive length of stay in A&E. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

[HYPERLINKS] 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of LAURA-JANE KIRSTEN NICOLE SEAMAN, AGE 36.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 August 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Ia Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Ib Massive Peritoneal Haemorrhage from Splenic Capsular and Peritoneal Tears with recent vaginal delivery. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues

Laura-Jane complained of feeling bleeding at 02:40, of feeling dizzy at 03:30 with required vital signs not being taken. Midwives failed to appropriately escalate Laura-Jane's maternal collapse at 03:45 whilst semi-recumbent in bed. Laura-Jane was treated for possible dehydration, but her condition continued to deteriorate. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: obstetric">Midwives failed to obtain required vital signs until 04:04 that were annotated on a piece of paper rather than on Modified Early Obstetric Warnings Scores (MEOWS) charts with the consequence that her deteriorating condition was not escalated.</span> There were multiple missed opportunities to escalate and treat Laura-Jane that were required. Laura-Jane continued to deteriorate with persistent low blood pressure and tachycardia that were indicative of hypovolemia. Laura-Jane suffered a splenic capsular tear on the labour ward that caused an intraperitoneal bleed that continued undetected in the absence of any examination of her abdomen. An urgent blood test taken at 04:45 was not chased and showed a drop in her haemoglobin that should have been known and escalated. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Laura-Jane was resuscitated and suffered a second arrest and again resuscitated and was given a blood transfusion when her haemoglobin was found to be significantly low. Laura-Jane underwent cardiac and abdominal scans that confirmed the absence of features of pulmonary embolism and the presence of intraabdominal haemorrhage. The major haemorrhage protocol was not called. Laura-Jane was conveyed to theatre for an emergency laparotomy that found a massive intraabdominal haemorrhage caused by splenic capsular tear treated appropriately with splenectomy. Advice from the Consultant Intensivist was successfully implemented to treat Laura-Jane who was critically unwell due to her cardiac arrests. Significant amounts of blood products were administered to Laura-Jane with the advice of haematology. Protamine was not administered until 10:40 to assist with reversal of low molecular weight heparin. A further laparotomy with required with second opinions during which Laura-Jane sustained peritoneal tears due to the condition of the tissues as there was ongoing bleeding with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy noted. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

(6) The Trust Executive Review Group ("ERG") Report was not shared with the Trust Director of Midwifery or the Head of Midwifery at Broomfield Hospital who did not agree with the ERG conclusions that: ‘The absence of escalation to an obstetric consultant was discussed and noted that the team escalated to an anaesthetist, which is usual practice in an obstetric emergency (putting out a call to the medical emergency team would not be common practice).' ‘The possible reasons why the bleeding was not identified were discussed and it was noted that in maternity cases the absence of vaginal bleeding and with no signs of uterine rupture it would be unlikely that the team would have considered bleeding as a cause of deterioration.' and gave evidence that this is not in accordance with good clinical practice or national guidelines and training. (9) Staff skill mix for doctors on the Labour Ward for the night of 20/21 December was staffed with a junior obstetric registrar with a newly qualified colleague in his first week and a junior anaesthetist, all with limited experience of working on the Labour Ward. (10) Quality of communication and handovers between Trust staff key information was omitted in handovers between staff at all levels including when Laura-Jane was taken to theatre as a medical emergency. (11) Therapeutic anticoagulation was administered without consultant obstetric input, further medical review or imaging where there had been hours of deranged vital signs that were inconsistent potential complications for pulmonary embolism. (12) No accounts were taken from Haematology, or the blood lab team involved with this massive haemorrhage by the Trust or the HSIB (who investigated this case) where massive amounts of blood products were prepared, dispensed and then administered where the timings and sharing of information were important to understand. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 February 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

(6) The Trust Executive Review Group ("ERG") Report was not shared with the Trust Director of Midwifery or the Head of Midwifery at Broomfield Hospital who did not agree with the ERG conclusions that: ‘The absence of escalation to an obstetric consultant was discussed and noted that the team escalated to an anaesthetist, which is usual practice in an obstetric emergency (putting out a call to the medical emergency team would not be common practice).' ‘The possible reasons why the bleeding was not identified were discussed and it was noted that in maternity cases the absence of vaginal bleeding and with no signs of uterine rupture it would be unlikely that the team would have considered bleeding as a cause of deterioration.' and gave evidence that this is not in accordance with good clinical practice or national guidelines and training. (9) Staff skill mix for doctors on the Labour Ward for the night of 20/21 December was staffed with a junior obstetric registrar with a newly qualified colleague in his first week and a junior anaesthetist, all with limited experience of working on the Labour Ward. (10) Quality of communication and handovers between Trust staff key information was omitted in handovers between staff at all levels including when Laura-Jane was taken to theatre as a medical emergency. (11) Therapeutic anticoagulation was administered without consultant obstetric input, further medical review or imaging where there had been hours of deranged vital signs that were inconsistent potential complications for pulmonary embolism. (12) No accounts were taken from Haematology, or the blood lab team involved with this massive haemorrhage by the Trust or the HSIB (who investigated this case) where massive amounts of blood products were prepared, dispensed and then administered where the timings and sharing of information were important to understand. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 February 2025.</td>

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Portsmouth Hospital NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Portsmouth Hospital NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Sally OLSEN, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15 August 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Susan EVANS aged 55. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: "On 11 July 2023, Susan Evans underwent elective Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The surgery went to plan and appropriate measures were taken to avoid the possibility of an anastomotic leak, a rare but recognised complication of gastric bypass surgery. Initially, Ms Evans recovered well, but she experienced abdominal pain in the early hours of 13 July 2023. It is likely that this was due to an anastomotic leak. 13 July 2023 was the first day of a junior doctors' strike. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

She was re-admitted to hospital on 15 July 2023. By this point she was extremely unwell with abdominal sepsis from an anastomotic leak. She underwent remedial surgery on 15 July 2023 and a further operation was required on 25 July 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

[HYPERLINKS] 3 INVESTIGATION On 7 March 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of THOMAS ADRIAN BURROUGHS, AGE 35.

(3) Mr Burroughs had a jejunal extension to his PEG on 15 January 2024.</span> Advice was received that the Hickman Catheter should be removed as soon as possible if it was not being used. (4) Mr Burroughs was tachycardic and spiked a temperature on 19 January 2024 with no apparent symptoms of recurrent aspiration and the Hickman Line remained in situ. (5) The Hickman Catheter was surgically removed on 30 January 2024. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 February 2025 .

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Department of Health & Social Care 39 Victoria Street London SW1H 0EU By Email only to :- [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Mrs D HOCKING, His Majesty's Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Leicester City and South Leicestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 29 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karen Pamela DACK aged 43. investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on .</span> The conclusion of the inquest was that: The cause of death was established as: I a Sepsis I b Spontaneous Bowel Perforation I c Sigmoid Diverticular Stricture II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Ms Dack had worsening symptoms of stricture and obstruction of the bowel. She had a colonoscopy on the 21 December 2023 which showed a stricture of the bowel. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">In April 2024, following admission via the emergency department, planned urgent surgery did not happen because there were no intensive care beds and her condition had appeared to have resolved.</span> She was fast tracked to have an elective bowel resection on the 17 May 2024. On the 02 May 2024, following another emergency admission she again had urgent surgery planned but it did not go ahead due to her surgery being superseded by other more urgent cases. Her treating consultant told this inquest that it was his plan to take Karen back to theatre the next day but this was not clearly communicated and Karen was discharged with the elective surgery still to take place as previously planned on the 17 May 2024, which was the plan written in the electronic records. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">There was no assessment by any senior surgeon as to Karen's fitness to be discharged and there was confusion about the management plan by the nurses on the ward.</span> Karen re-presented to the emergency department four days later with worsening abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">She had not suffered a perforated bowel at the time of admission, but the plan was that she should be taken to theatre for a laparoscopic bowel resection the following day.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">Due to the volume of operations at this time this did not take place on the 07 May and was planned for the next day.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">It is clear from the evidence that Karen's condition deteriorated suddenly on the morning of the 08 May 2024, most likely due to perforation of her bowel.</span> Once this was recognised surgery was completed urgently but Karen did not recover and became septic and sadly died despite the surgeons attempts to save her with several further operations. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The evidence heard is that had Karen had any of the planned operations before her bowel perforated on the 08 May she would have survived. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)
Keywords: availability">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) That this lady's surgery was cancelled at the last minute on three separate occasions due to lack of theatre availability.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">I heard from the Deputy Clinical Director at Leicester Royal Infirmary that there has been a review of how patients are prioritised and whether they are effectively using their emergency theatre capacity.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">He said that ‘the obvious problem with emergencies is they are unpredictable, there are times when the emergency list only requires one theatre and there are times when there are so many cases on the emergency list that we need to cancel elective cases in order to accommodate them and SOPs are in place around this.' He went on to say that there were no imminent plans for theatre expansion at the University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) and that the categorisation and access to emergency theatres are probably as good as they can get with the currently available resources.</span> I am concerned that whilst UHL is doing its utmost to deal with this problem the fact is that regardless of how patients are categorised there are still the same number of theatres available and that this issue will happen again, and further deaths may occur. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 31, 2025.

Deceased name: Michael Thompson
Coroners name: Louise Hunt

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Louise Hunt for Birmingham and Solihull 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22 August 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John THOMPSON. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was; Died from a recognised complication of necessary surgery for chondrosarcoma 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Thompson was found to have an extensive chondrosarcoma of the pelvis. He was admitted to the Royal Orthopaedic hospital on 05/04/24 and had a right sided hindquarter amputation and soft tissue reconstruction on 08/04/24. This was complex surgery involving two consultant orthopaedic oncology surgeons and plastic surgeons. During the surgery a defect was made in the peritoneum during resection of the tumour which was repaired with sutures and bleeding was controlled from the internal iliac vein. There was damage to the contralateral common iliac vein likely caused by dissection during the surgery. This vein injury was difficult to control and required surgeons to attend from University Hospital Birmingham who repaired the defect with a synthetic vascular graft. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring
Keywords: monitoring">The surgery was completed and as he was unstable Mr Thompson was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital ITU for 4 days for resuscitation and closer monitoring.</span> He returned to the Royal orthopaedic hospital on 12/04/24 and appeared to be making good recovery. He developed hiccups overnight on 15/16th April which were treated medically with a plan to arrange a CT scan if this did not resolve. In the early hours of 18/04/24 he sadly collapsed having had a large vomit and should not be resuscitated. Post-mortem examination found a defect in the peritoneum through which small bowel had become herniated leading to vomiting and aspiration. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a ASPIRATION 1b INTERNAL HERNIA WITH SMALL BOWEL EXTENDING THROUGH A DEFECT IN THE PERITONEUM INTO THE SURGICAL BED 1c HINDQUARTER AMPUTATION FOR CHONDROSARCOMA 1d II 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. During the surgery on 08/04/24 a defect was made in the peritoneum whilst dissecting this away from the tumour and the defect was repaired with sutures. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: staff + staff + record">The operation note did not record this complication and other staff were unaware of it.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + record">This raises a concern about the adequacy of record keeping in the Trust as a key aspect of the patient's surgery was not recorded. 2.</span> Under the PSIRF process a PSII investigation was undertaken however this only dealt with resuscitation efforts and did not address the peritoneal defect and its repair which was the root cause of Mr Thompson's death. This raises a concern about the adequacy of investigations being undertaken by the Trust and their ability to learn from deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 31 January 2025.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 NHS England 2 Secretary of State for Health 1 CORONER I am Elizabeth GRAY, Area Coroner for the coroner area of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patricia CURTIS aged 80.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 November 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The conclusion of the inquest was that: Patricia Curtis died as a result of a known, but extremely rare complication of necessary post operative treatment 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs Curtis underwent mitral valve repair, tricuspid valve repair, coronary artery by pass grafting x 3 and atrial appendage exclusion on 17 March 2021 at Royal Papworth Hospital.</span> Her post operative recovery was lengthy and she was repatriated to Bedford Hospital on 1 April 2021. On 2 April 2023 following arrival at Bedford Hospital Mrs Curtis deteriorated rapidly in the early hours of the morning. Post mortem examination determined that her cause of death was a haemothorax which on the balance of probability had started to develop gradually following a removal of her chest drain at Royal Papworth Hospital before transfer to Bedford Hospital. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

This report is being sent to: Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive Officer Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Pond Street Rosslyn Hill London NW3 2QG 1 CORONER I am Ian Potter, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Inner North London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 April 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Mnayea ZMF Al Basman, aged 72 years at the time of his death.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 6 November and 3 December 2024. The inquest concluded with a short narrative conclusion in the following terms. ‘known complication of necessary surgical procedure'. The medical cause of death was: 1a intra-abdominal sepsis / peritonitis 1b anastomotic leak at site of right hemicolectomy 1c caecal adenocarcinoma (operated) II end-stage renal failure, atherosclerosis, congestive cardiac failure 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH Mr Al Basman had an extensive past medical history and significant underlying co-morbidities. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: patient + patient">He was admitted to the private patient unit at the Royal Free Hospital on 11 March 2024, to undergo a right hemicolectomy to excise a caecal adenocarcinoma, planned for the following day.</span> Mr Al Basman's co-morbidities increased his general and specific surgical risks, but he was found to be fit to undergo the surgery. The surgical procedure itself was ‘technically challenging' but otherwise uneventful. Mr Al Basman showed signs of reasonable post-operative recovery until the weekend of 23/24 March 2024. From 24 March 2024, he deteriorated suddenly. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Some aspects of his condition and clinical presentation that weekend should have been escalated to the consultant surgeon in charge of his care but were not; however, it is not possible to say that earlier escalation would have altered the outcome.</span> On Monday 25 March 2024, Mr Al Basman deteriorated further and died in hospital. Mr Al Basman's death was the direct result of sepsis/peritonitis caused by an anastomotic leak at the site of the right hemicolectomy. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Anastomotic leak is a known complication of this surgical procedure. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) The consultant colorectal surgeon was not in the hospital over the weekend of 23/24 March 2024; however, he was able to be contacted if the need arose. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: informed + care + care + care + team">The consultant surgeon noted the following matters in relation to the care provided to Mr Al Basman over that weekend: - a further CT scan could have been indicated, particularly given issues with Mr Al Basman's drain, albeit there was nothing to indicate that any scan was needed on an urgent basis; - some entries in the clinical notes may have been ‘falsely reassuring'; the physiotherapist who saw Mr Al Basman on the morning of 24 March 2024, noted that he appeared to be ‘declining' but there was no evidence that this was escalated this to someone within the healthcare team; - there was a degree of insufficient professional curiosity on the part of some clinicians who saw Mr Al Basman; and - there should have been a plan in place to closely observe Mr Al Basman overnight on 24/25 March 2024. 2) Based on the above, the consultant surgeon formed the view that Mr Al Basman's clinical presentation should have led to the consultant being informed and consulted, but it did not. 3) A number of the notes/records in relation to the care provided to Mr Al Basman, particularly over the weekend of 23/24 March 2024, lacked detail.</span> Given that the events preceding Mr Al Basman's death have not been the subject of an internal investigation, I received little, if any, reassurance that these matters have been addressed. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of the report, namely 28 January 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following: Mr Al Basman's family I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust 2. Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust 3. University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Assistant Coroner Stephen Covell, Assistant Coroner for Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 April 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Norma Ann Patricia Tellam. I concluded the investigation at the end of the inquest on 8 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental Death. The cause of death was; 1a Upper Gastro Intestinal Haemorrhage 1b Proximal Femoral Fracture (operated) 1c Fall 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 22 January 2023 Norma Ann Patricia Tellam suffered an unwitnessed fall near her home sustaining a left proximal femoral fracture. On 23 January 2023 Mrs Tellam underwent surgery at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro to repair the fracture using a femoral intramedullary nail together with additional metalwork to stabilise and strengthen the repair. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

Keywords: staff + staff">On 4 February 2023 clinical staff became concerned that Mrs Tellam surgical hip wound might be infected.</span> Mrs Tellam was sent to the emergency department at Derriford Hospital University Hospitals Plymouth rather than to the Royal Cornwall Hospital where the original operation was carried out. Mrs Tellam was returned to Liskeard hospital on 5 February 2023 after an infection was discounted. On 10 February 2023 Mrs Tellam was sent again to Derriford Hospital with symptoms of a suspected infection. A chest infection was subsequently diagnosed and Mrs Tellam was admitted to Derriford Hospital where she remained until 21 February 2023 having subsequently developed Covid. On 11 February 2023 whilst Mrs Tellam was at Derriford Hospital her hip was x-rayed and reviewed by an orthopaedic consultant who identified some movement in the metalwork from the operation particularly a nail in the femoral head. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">He anticipated that Mrs Tellam would need to have some extra surgery and that she would be transferred back to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where the original operation had been carried out and under whose care she remained, as soon as her chest infection resolved.</span> Mrs Tellam was returned to Liskeard Community Hospital on 21 February 2023 where attempts were made to rehabilitate her and improve her mobility. In the light of issues highlighted by the x-rays taken at Derriford, it would have been good practice to return Mrs Tellam to the Royal Cornwall Hospital for follow up. Mrs Tellam continued to experience significant levels of pain from the hip joint and was x- rayed at Liskeard on 16 March 2023.. The x-ray identified that the nail in the femoral head had moved further and was now protruding into the hip socket. It is likely that the movement was caused by the rehabilitation. The x-ray was discussed with the orthopaedic team at Royal Cornwall Hospital. Mrs Tellam was re-admitted to Royal Cornwall Hospital from Liskeard Community Hospital where she underwent on 23 March 2023 a operation to remove the metalwork from the original operation and subsequent total hip replacement. Mrs Tellam initially made satisfactory progress after the operation however on 16 April 2023 she became very unwell suffering an upper gastro intestinal bleed and died at 0630 on 16 April 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Chief Executive Officer, Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, 369, Fulham Road, London.</span> SW10 9NH [REDACTED], Medical Director NHS England By email: [REDACTED] [REDACTED], Chief Medical Examiner for England and Wales, By email: [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Professor Fiona J Wilcox, HM Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Inner West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 18 th , 19 th and 20 th November 2024, evidence was heard touching the death of Master Elton Michael Deutekom. He had died on the 12 th January 2022, thirty seven minutes after he had been born on labour ward at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Medical Cause of Death 1 a. Acute perinatal hypoxia/ischaemia ("perinatal asphyxia") b. Placental abruption II Placental delayed chorionic villous maturation How, when, where the deceased came by his death: Elton's mother was transferred to labour ward at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital from the community at 01:25 on 12 th January 2022. Her labour initially progressed well. At approximately 0320- 0330 she suffered an abrupted placenta. As a result, Elton suffered an acute hypoxic ischaemic injury. This was undiagnosed by those caring for Elton's mother despite a sharp change in her clinical presentation manifesting as severe pain, strong contractions and rapid progression to push and CTG (Cardiotachograph) changes consistent with hypoxia from 0334, when his mother was reattached to the monitor. Elton's baseline heart rate had gone up significantly, increasing by 30 beats per minute, followed by decelerations. There was no heart rate detected after 0414. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: obstetric">This change in base rate followed by decelerations was unrecognised by the obstetric registrar, despite her being in the room with Elton's mother from about 0335 to at least 0348.</span> The registrar relied on the historic CTG trace, rather than the trace at the time of her assessment. This was a serious failure that contributed to Elton's death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

The labour ward co-ordinator responded to hearing Elton's mother screaming at approximately 0420 and allocated a senior midwife to assist. Neither recognised how long Elton had had an abnormal CTG. The emergency bell was not activated until 0430. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">The emergency team responded promptly, and Elton was delivered by forceps at 04:35.</span> Despite resuscitation his life could not be saved, and he was recognised as life extinct at 05:12. If Elton had been recognised as suffering with hypoxia and delivered before 04:05 on the balance of probabilities, he would have survived. Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death: Natural Causes contributed to by neglect. 4 Evidence relevant to the matters of concern. Extensive evidence was taken and exhibited and some potential regulation 28 matters explored. Of relevance to this report: 1. The midwife caring for Elton's mother who took over from the community midwife was very newly qualified and had only been managing women in labour independently for a couple of weeks. This midwife appeared to be distracted by administration tasks and TED stockings when she should have been prioritising the abnormal CTG. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">She made no contemporaneous notes in the medical records and entered information into the notes retrospectively some four- five hours later with the help of a midwife supervisor advising her.</span> The supernumery time spent by a newly qualified mid-wife has not changed since this incident, but there is more training provided now post qualification than at the time of Elton's death. 2. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: care">A finding of fact was made that had the community midwife remained to care for Elton's mother whilst in labour, it is likely that she would have recognised the abnormal CTG and acute change in Elton's mother in terms of pain and summoned help appropriately and Elton would have had an expedited delivery and survived. 3.</span> The labour ward has nine rooms all of which were full, but only 8 midwives including the Labour Ward Co-ordinator who should be just assisting not managing women in labour on a 1:1 basis. This was and is currently the usual number. The labour ward was busy with all rooms occupied. This meant that some midwives were caring for 2 women even without covering breaks. It was so busy that the community midwife who had accompanied Elton's mother to the ward was asked to remain with her until 0315. It was so busy that no practitioner picked up on Elton having an abnormal CTG at the CTG central monitoring station, nor was able to provide ad hoc support to the newly qualified midwife caring for Elton's mother until the Labour Ward Co-ordinator responded after hearing Elton's mother screaming. The evidence was that this level of business is usual on the labour ward. The labour ward was effectively 2 midwives short. This may have contributed to his death. 4. Elton's death occurred on 12 th January 2022 but was not referred to the coroner until 17 th June 2022, and then the evidence presented suggested a still birth since he had only had a heart rate for a couple of minutes after 23 minutes of resuscitation, and did not highlight labour management issues. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">This understanding of the court came from information supplied by the hospital and resulted in a PIRH on 12 th July 2022 to determine whether Elton was a stillbirth.</span> He had never been treated as such by the hospital and had been treated as a neonatal death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

That Chelsea and Westminster Hospital are not appropriately referring neonatal deaths to coroner- either late or not at all, and this raises the possibly that lessons may not be learned from the investigation of these deaths that may save the lives of others. 2. That Chelsea and Westminster hospital may not be complying with the duty of candour to disclose evidence relevant to a death to the coroner until forced to by court directions made in public, which thus raises the same concern as above. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff

REGULATION 28: REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Department of Health and Social Care, 39, Victoria Street, London.</span> SW1H 0EU. 1 CORONER I am Professor Fiona J Wilcox, HM Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Inner West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 26 th and 27 th November 2024, evidence was heard touching the death of Mr Junior George Powell, who died on 6 th September 2021 at St George's Hospital aged 57 years. Medical Cause of Death 1 a. Intestinal Ischaemia b. Aortic Dissection with arterial branch occlusion How, when, where the deceased came by his death: Mr Powell presented at approximately 22:00 to St George's Hospital on 3 rd September of 2021 with acute onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. Initial CT scanning did not find nay surgical cause for his symptoms. He was reviewed at 05:15 on the 4 th September 2021 by the medical registrar who was concerned about his pain and worsening clinical condition. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: analysis">In retrospective analysis of the CT scan images subtle changes were noted that prompted further imaging if his vascular system.</span> This showed an abdominal aortic dissection, reduced blow flow to the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries and evidence of intestinal ischaemia. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">He was reviewed by the general surgeons, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists, by which time he deteriorated further.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">He underwent resection of his bowel midmorning on 4 th September 2021 but received no surgical treatment to restore blood flow to the abdominal arteries or treat the dissection in the aorta.</span> He was heparinised only. As a result, his condition continued to deteriorate and he developed increasing ischaemic damage to his abdominal organs. Despite further resection of his by now necrotic gall bladder and damaged bowel on 5 th September 2021, he died at 15:49 on 6 th September 2021 on GITU. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">If mechanical restoration of blood flow to the abdominal arteries had occurred on the morning of 4 th September 2021 or by late afternoon of 4 th September 2021, on the balance of probabilities he would not have died at this time.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">As such the lack of treatment to reduced flow to the arteries via mechanical means contributed to his death.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death: Natural Causes contributed to by lack of definitive treatment of the aortic dissection. 4 Evidence relevant to the matters of concern Extensive evidence was taken and exhibited and some potential Regulation 28 matters explored.</span> Of relevance to this report: They was a more than five hour delay before Mr Powell was reviewed by the medical registrar and he should have been in a bed in the medical ward by 01:15. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">This delay was caused by shortage of staff during that night and he was eventually seen by the medical registrar who should have been based on the ward, not seeing patients in accident and emergency.</span> Evidence was taken that confirmed that such delays are usual, not just in St George's Hospital, and delays in admission to the wards are caused largely by the inability to discharge patients who are fit for discharge due to lack of suitable social support in the community. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: treatment + care + care + conditions + time + care">In this case, treatment for Mr Powell was time critical and as such this delay probably contributed to his death. 5 Matters of Concern That delay in discharge for patients ready to be discharged due to lack of suitable social care in the community is causing congestion in the hospital admission process, delaying medical assessment and thus diagnosis of conditions that need urgent treatment and increasing the likelihood of death for such patients. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.</span> It is for each addressee to respond to matters relevant to them. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

Deceased name: Alfie Hinton
Coroners name: Charlotte Keighley
Coroners Area: West Yorkshire Western
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths | Child Death (from 2015)
This report is being sent to: Airedale NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . Airedale NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Charlotte KEIGHLEY, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Yorkshire Western Coroner Area 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 May 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alfie HINTON aged 23 minutes. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 November 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">The conclusion of the inquest was that: Baby Alfie Hinton died as a consequence of hypoxic ischemic brain injury sustained during the intrapartum period arising from delays in the management of his medical care.</span> His death was contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Baby Alfie Hinton died at Airedale Hospital on the 10th May 2019 as a consequence of complete umbilical cord occlusion leading to hypoxic ischemic brain injury. In the days leading up to his death and whilst in utero, Alfie experienced a period of chronic hypoxia arising from placental insufficiency which made him more vulnerable to any further hypoxic events. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: maternity">On the 8 th May 2019, Alfie's mum was admitted to hospital through the Maternity Assessment Centre for Induction of Labour as a consequence of extremely high levels of bile acids, which were recorded at 149, with anything over 100 increasing the risk of stillbirth tenfold.</span> Induction of labour was requested ‘as soon as possible', the expectation being that the induction would commence, at the latest, the following morning, but induction was in fact commenced at 2250 hours on the 9 th May 2019, following a significant delay arising from the unavailability of beds on the Labour Ward. Once Induction of Labour commenced, the plan was for six hourly fetal monitoring with additional monitoring at the point when contractions commenced. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + between + between">At some point between 0700 hours and 0904 hours on the morning of the 10th May 2019, Alfie experienced an acute hypoxic event from which he recovered, the effects of this event would have been recognised earlier had monitoring taken place on time or alternatively at the point when contractions commenced.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + staff + staff">At the time contractions commenced, staff on the ward were engaged with other patients, consequently, there was no one to inform.</span> The scheduled six hourly monitoring was delayed by 39 minutes with bradycardia being identified soon after the commencement of the trace. The bradycardia was not acted upon immediately and therefore preparations for birth were delayed. There were further delays once preparations commenced and at some point during the 12 minutes prior to Alfie's delivery at 1441, a complete cord occlusion occurred from which Alfie was unable to recover. Upon delivery his heart was slow and despite resuscitation attempts Alfie did not survive. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Alfie's death was confirmed at 1504 hours the same day. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: allocation">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) (1) During the course of the Inquest, I could find no evidence of how or if the maternal risks were assessed following her admission, nor how the level of risk posed by the level of bile acids was communicated to those tasked with prioritising those patients awaiting induction of labour and therefore the allocation of staffing and resources.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: equipment + awareness + staff + staff">This is further reflected in the 39 minute delay in CTG monitoring and the fact that at the point Bradycardia was noted, the initial assumption from staff was that there was an issue with the monitoring equipment, there being little awareness of the risks already present, which contributed to delays in expediting delivery.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

(2) During the course of the Inquest, I heard evidence about the difficulties in communication between the Consultant Obstetrician and Consultant Anaesthetist, with delays being caused by several attempts being made at siting spinal anaesthetic, against the advice of the Obstetrician and the wishes of the patient, causing distress to staff and patient alike.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I have also sent it to CQC Leeds who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

This report is being sent to: Norfolk Community Health & Care NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Norfolk Community Health & Care NHS Trust (NCHC) Woodlands House Norwich Community Hospital Bowthorpe Road Norwich NR2 3TU 1 CORONER I am Jacqueline LAKE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Norfolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kenneth George Willard KING aged 76.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 November 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Septic Shock 1b) Bilateral Leg Cellulitis 1c) 2) Type Two Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension The conclusion of the inquest was: Mr King died from septic shock due to bilateral leg cellulitis. His wounds were not always dressed in accordance with the recommended time scales. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr King had a significant medical history. He was referred to the Community Nursing Team in June 2023 due to a wound on his right ankle. Mr King was rereferred in July 2023 when he had three wound sites. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">He was seen and continued to receive assessment and dressings to his wounds in the community.</span> At various times there were delays in Mr King being seen in accordance with recommendations sometimes by five or six days. Mr King was at times prescribed antibiotics. On 10 October 2023 blood tests were taken and Mr King's inflammatory markers were significantly elevated. He attended hospital but then self-discharged. He returned to hospital the next day and was admitted. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Following intravenous antibiotics he was discharged to Ambulatory care on 14 October 2023 and returned to hospital on a daily basis for intravenous antibiotics until 21 October 2023, (not attending on 20 October 2023) when he was discharged to community care with oral antibiotics for five days.</span> Mr King was not referred to the community nursing team. An urgent visit by community nursing was requested on 27 October 2023 when Mr King had signs of infection. On 28 October 2023 Mr King was triaged and seen that day and his dressings were changed. Mr King was seen on 31 October and on 5 November 2023 when his dressings were changed. Swabs were taken on 8 November 2023 when a huge amount of strike through was noted on the left leg and a moderate amount of exude green in colour present on the right leg. Evidence was heard there was a mild malodor. Mr King's dressings were changed on the morning of 10 November 2023. Evidence was heard there was no malodor and no sign of infection on this occasion neither of which is referred to in the written records. A referral was made for increased visits. Later that day Mr King was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with cellulitis of both legs, being generally unwell and confused. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) NCHC have taken action and put in place many steps to prevent future deaths. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">However, I do have two ongoing concerns as follows: 1.</span> Evidence was heard that there is no formal structure in place as to when or with regard to the frequency of carrying out physiological observations on patients in the community. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + patient">Observations are required to be taken if the attending clinician has any concerns about the patient's wellbeing or a deterioration in their condition, or at the request of a senior clinician or GP.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + attendance">No specific questions are asked of the patient, such as if they are feeling unwell, have pain or localised heat, the attending practitioner relies on general conversation carried out at their attendance to help form a view as to whether observations are required to be taken.</span> It was accepted in evidence that the decision to perform observations relies on the clinical judgment of the relevant clinician, which is a subjective decision which may be exercised incorrectly and at variance with other clinicians. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">Different clinicians carry out visits in the community and so have no overall view of a patient's presentation and any deterioration.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record, attendance">Written records are available but evidence was heard that in this case, on the last visit, the record of the previous attendance was looked at and no history prior to that.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Evidence was heard that Health Care Practitioners may have limited clinical training and rely on instructions and advice from trained nurses.</span> In this case, evidence was heard that Mr King presented as feeling well but had high inflammatory markers, which may mask when observations are required to be carried out. Some patients may not be forthcoming about any symptoms unless specifically asked. 2. Mr King died a year ago and although there is a training programme which is being devised and rolled out it is not expected to be in place for a further eighteen months. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

On 6 th March 2023 Colin was assigned a social worker and support was offered. Colin was offered alternative living arrangements for a short while but declined with capacity to make his own decisions. On the 7 th March 2023, the social worker once again visited Colin, and this time support was accepted from the Red Cross. On 8 th March Colin was discharged home. Due to ongoing concerns a Vulnerable Adults Risk Management (VARM) meeting was suggested. The Red Cross did support Colin but raised concerns about his house. Colin declined further support on 10 th March 2023 but said he knew what to do if he needed support in the future. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Colin was critically unwell when the ambulance crew assessed him, and he was conveyed under blue lights and sirens Hull Royal Infirmary who were pre alerted by the ambulance that he was en route. Despite best efforts at Hull Royal Infirmary, Colin sadly passed away at 15:00 hours on the 27 th March at Hull Royal Infirmary. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

At 02:58 on 27 th March 2023 the CSP level was escalated to Level 3, as Category 3 response times had increased to 10 hours and 5 minutes. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: safety + clear + conditions">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - No Vulnerable Adult Risk Management meeting was held despite multifactorial concerns with Mr Wiles' comorbities and self neglect leading to poor living conditions and increased risk to his safety It does not seem clear whether callers are advised to call the emergency services back if they continue to have concerns.</span> The waiting times for ambulances to hand over patients at Hull Royal Infirmary were excessive that day leading to 160 hours of lost ambulance time. There appears to be an issue with no criteria to reside patients and the ability to hand over patients into ED in Hull Royal Infirmary who arrive in emergency ambulances. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22 nd January 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period and acknowledge it is the Christmas and New Year period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: the family Colin Wiles, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and Humberside Police as well as the agencies identified at the top of this report. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 [DATE] [SIGNED BY CORONER] 24 th November 2024 Sally Robinson, Assistant Coroner

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: (1) The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. (2) NHS England. (3) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 1 CORONER I am MICHAEL SPENCER, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of East Sussex. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicolette Elizabeth McCARTHY aged 46.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy died as a result of suicide due to her acute mental ill health and a series of contributory factors. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: safety + mental health + concerns">There were a series of failures in the systems and procedures which should have guaranteed her safety. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The jury made the following findings of fact in Box 3 of the Record of Inquest: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy was detained to the Woodlands secure unit - under the Mental Health Act - Section 5(2) for concerns of her own safety following attempts to take her life.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">On the 18th and 19th September there remained a risk that she may attempt to end her own life.</span> On 18th September 2023, Nicolette's family attended the ward round discussion, there is no evidence that confirmation of escorted or unescorted leave was delivered to them. Any ambiguity could have been avoided if Trust procedures had been followed, written confirmation of the S17 decision provided and acknowledged by the family. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk assessment, risk, assessment">It was appropriate to grant in principle unescorted S17 leave but not implement it until written confirmation was provided to the family and the risk assessment updated.</span> Nicolette should not have been required to leave unit grounds. Although the NHS/Sussex Trust have a policy that no smoking should take place within the grounds, there should have been provisions that within secure units secure smoking facilities or indeed an exemption should have been made. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">As per the Trust's "Record of Patient leave" form, checks and consideration should have been given to the appropriateness of any items Nicolette had on her person for the leave being taken.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: immediate action + risk">As per the Trust's concession, the Trust did not take immediate action, aligned to Nicolette's individual clinical risk, when Nicolette did not return to the ward, following her 15 minutes leave (starting at 14:37) on 19 September 2023.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: gaps">The failure to mark Nicolette as AWOL rather than on leave added to the confusion and highlighted gaps in the record keeping.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staffing levels + staff + staff">Although staffing levels were low and incidents on 19th September 2023 further impacted staff availability, there was a failure to take steps as outlined in Trust policies following identification of Nicolette's absence.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + patient">There were further factors in play: 1) insufficient adherence to recording patient login time in the procedure on the S17 leave sheet. 2) unacceptable delays in taking appropriate action on 19th September. 3) the Trust's adherence to robust note keeping/updating appears to have been lax and retrospective at times.</span> <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: prompt action + concerns + staff + staff">It is possible that on 19th September 2023, had staff taken prompt action there would have been opportunities by which Nicolette's death could have been avoided 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mental health + risk + staff + staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from clinicians and staff at the Trust to the effect that the NHS England smoke free policy is placing mental health in patients at an increased risk from self-harm and suicide.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: mental health + treatment">Although smoking cessation advice and treatment (e.g. gum, vapes etc.) are routinely offered to patients, the evidence was that many struggle to give up smoking on their admission to the ward, in part because the anxiety associated with stopping exacerbates their mental health symptoms.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Staff also felt that forcing patients to stop smoking against their will (e.g. by prohibiting them from smoking while on leave) would have a negative effect on their sense of autonomy and wellbeing, which are important for recovery.</span> The Trust understand that they are bound by the Health Act 2006 and by NHS England policy not to permit or facilitate smoking on the ward or anywhere on the grounds of the hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: seriously + staff + staff">This is taken seriously and is interpreted to mean that staff are prohibited from facilitating smoking, for example by granting leave for the purpose of smoking or by escorting patients to smoke outside on short periods of leave.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Senior staff also believed that it would be contrary to NHS policy to permit smoking in a secure area, for example the enclosed ward garden.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: mental health + time">At the same time, it was acknowledged that patients would inevitably seek leave to smoke and that this could not be denied without a negative impact on their mental health.</span> The jury heard evidence that patients, like Mrs McCarthy, were routinely given 15- minute grounds leave for the purpose of smoking, a practice that is discouraged by the Trust. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: higher + risk + between, staff + between, staff, patient">Clinical staff felt that the policy placed them in a difficult position, torn between the need to comply with the smoke free policy, while also supporting patient autonomy and keeping safe those patients who are at a higher risk of self- harm or suicide.</span> There is a further contradiction caused by the smoke free policy, in that patients are not permitted to smoke on the grounds, but are not supposed to leave the grounds during short periods of ‘grounds' leave. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: poorly + staff + staff">The result is that patients would spend their 15-minute leave smoking by the side of the road on the edge of the ward grounds, which is a poorly supervised area, and staff would avoid asking them too closely where they were going and would avoid standing close to them, even when smoking themselves.</span> This contributed to the circumstances that allowed Mrs McCarthy to slip away unnoticed and ultimately to take her own life. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + staff + staff + national, guidance">I also heard evidence from senior staff that the national policy guidance intended to address smoking and s17 leave (e.g. the NICE Guidance and CQC Guidance) does not adequately resolve these contradictions.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: safety + mental health">I am concerned that the NHS smoke free policy, while clearly motivated by a genuine and pressing concern to protect life and promote health, may not be adequately tailored to reflect the safety requirements of mental health wards or the reality that some mental health patients will inevitably seek short periods of leave to smoke.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: mental health + guidance + risk + national, guidance">Action may need to be taken at the national policy level to provide clearer guidance and/or review the law to reduce the risk of patients in mental health wards absconding while on unescorted grounds leave. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 January 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Southern Health Foundation Trust 2 Chief Coroner - PFD Reports 1 CORONER I am Mrs Rachel Spearing, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth & Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 12 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dean John Mark Anthony BRAY aged 47. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 November 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The conclusion of the inquest was that: Mr Dean Bray died of Acute Heart Failure on the 29th December 2021 whilst in the seclusion room on Hamtun Ward where there was a failure to adequately act upon and escalate Dean's high respiratory rate by nursing staff over the 28th and 29th December 2021 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Dean Bray died of Acute Heart Failure on the 29th December 2021 whilst in the seclusion room on Hamtun Ward where there was a failure to adequately act upon and escalate Dean's high respiratory rate by nursing staff over the 28th and 29th December 2021 Narrative Conclusion The Jury's conclusion is Natural Death contributed to by Neglect.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring
Keywords: concerns + inadequate + monitoring">There was a gross failure to escalate Dean's deteriorating physical presentations on 28th December after 21:43 up until 08:00 on 29th December 2021, based on inadequate monitoring of Dean's physical health and a lack of recognition of Dean's medical emergency which, on the balance of probabilities but for the gross failures, Dean's life probably could have been prolonged. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: staff + staff, patient + patient">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Firstly, Staff conducting 121 observations upon a patient within the seclusion room were unable to make a direct 999 emergency call from the observation room as no outside line was available from this handset to respond to a medical emergency.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)

Keywords: access">The most immediate access route to the ward used by secure transport services being unknown by South Central Ambulance Service and not shared with them to assist responding to a medical emergency at Antelope House. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 16, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Keywords: medication">On the 14th March 2023 Emma was taken to the Emergency Department at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth after she disclosed that she had taken an overdose of her prescribed medication.</span> At this time the hospital was experiencing extreme capacity pressures and Emma was placed in the cohorting corridor which was being staffed by paramedics due to the capacity pressures. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the inquest evidence was heard that: 1). <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

Keywords: care">The aims of this plan for Emma were: - to provide a consistent approach when Emma presented to the emergency department - to streamline her care so that she does not have to wait any longer than necessary in the ED as she has identified this makes her feel worse - to minimise the impact on emergency department resources when Emma attends - to reduce the use of restrictive interventions which may exacerbate Emma's distress 2).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

When Emma arrived at the hospital, she was taken to the cohorting area and was booked into the hospital by the triage nurse from the hospital, although was not seen by them and her previous records were not accessed. 4). <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Deceased name: Charlotte Roscoe
Coroners name: Michael Pemberton
Coroners Area: Manchester (West)
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Royal Bolton Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Royal Bolton Hospital 1 CORONER I am Michael James Pemberton, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester (West). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 April 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Ann ROSCOE aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes, and the medical cause of death was: 1a Haemopericardium, 1b Rupture roof of Aorta 1c Dissection of Ascending Aorta 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased attended the Royal Bolton Hospital on 22 January 2024, with chest pains and was suspected to have a chest infection. An ECG was performed and steps were taken to confirm a working diagnosis of whether there was a pulmonary embolism with a chest X-ray being performed. A scan was then requested to confirm if there was a pulmonary embolism, which was considered by a Radiologist. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + national, guidance">National Guidance was followed and a VQ test or a CTPA could be undertaken.</span> Evidence was provided that a CTPA could have been undertaken but was not, because a VQ test was available and either of them was an approved manner of determining whether there was a Pulmonary Embolism. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: factors">After considering clinical factors, a VQ test was done which confirmed that there was no Pulmonary Embolism.</span> This test would not detect any cardiac anomalies whereas types of CT scan probably would do and be likely to lead to other tests. No follow up occurred on the chest x ray result which showed a cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) 14/25cm on the basis that a visual inspection of the image was considered normal. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">A clinical assessment leading to discharge was undertaken on 23 January just before 5:00pm and observations were considered normal.</span> These observations were last taken at 7:11am and two sets of observations that should have occurred in the intervening period where not done, the discharge decision was therefore based on outdated observations and notes of the consultation were not accurate. She returned to her home address [REDACTED] with a suspected lower respiratory tract infection, but no formal diagnosis having been made. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">On arrival home, the deceased went to bed feeling sick and had not arisen by the time her parents went to work the following day.</span> On her father's return home at approximately 3:00pm, she was found to be deceased with her death being verified at 3:38pm by paramedics. A post mortem examination found that she had died as a consequence of a dissection of the ascending aorta and ruptured root of aorta leading to haemopericardium. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: concerns">Whilst there was a missed opportunity to detect the unidentified Aortic Dissection by undertaking a CT scan, it cannot be said on balance of probabilities that this would have prevented death given the catastrophic nature and low survivability rate. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">During the course of evidence Royal College of Radiographer guidance was referred to, specifically that a CTPA scan or VQ scan where equally appropriate when considering diagnosis of a Pulmonary Embolism.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: review + attendance">A first draft of an After Action Report which was concluded without Radiographer attendance at the after action review meeting was provided at the first part heard inquest hearing on 1 August 2024.</span> This made reference in the actions section of the report to the need to consider whether VQ scans should be replaced by CTPA's for all patients suspected of having a Pulmonary Embolism. This action was not included in an Amended After Action report provided at the resumed inquest. It is unclear whether this matter has been considered. 2. Evidence was received from a doctor who referred the deceased for a scan, that she had thought she had requested a CTPA to be undertaken, but the form that was used was a request for an ‘acute pulmonary embolus investigation' which meant that the request would be vetted and an appropriate mode of scan arranged following consideration by a radiologist. It was stated by the doctor that it would not be normal to speak to radiology regarding a request for a scan. 3. In evidence from a radiologist it was stated that a medical clinician would be expected to speak to a radiologist if there was any preference for a type of scan to be undertaken so this could be discussed. It appeared to me that the use of the correct form, need to be specific, provide rationale for a specific type of scan request, and liaising with radiology as appropriate was not appreciated in this case. As above, given that there was no radiographer involved in the After Action Report or action raised, it is unclear if this matter has been considered, or any actions taken to prevent future confusion. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 16 January 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] [REDACTED] I have also sent it to The Royal College of Radiologists who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: patient">The jury made a determination that the deceased died within 3 hours of being administered an Olanzapine depot injection which caused Olanzapine toxicity, whilst a psychiatric in-patient on Sapphire Ward, St Pancras Hospital, London N1.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: medication">She was treated with a wide variety of psychiatric medication administered both orally and by depot injection.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + staff + staff">Following admission to Sapphire Ward, a decision was made by the consultant along with other hospital staff to introduce Olanzapine to Yemisi's treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering
Keywords: inadequate + administering">Yemisi was administered Olanzapine orally for 3-4 days, falling below the recommended trial period advised before moving to administering by depot injection and was therefore inadequate.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: decisions">As Olanzapine is a non-formulary drug for the Trust, additional requirements are in place to support prescribing decisions.</span> The justification relied upon by the consultant and lead pharmacist for prescribing the drug was unsuitable as the drug does not meet the criteria outlined in Section 62 of the Mental Health Act of being a) life-saving, or b) reversible. In addition, the requirement to seek a second opinion from an independent doctor in certain circumstances when changing medications was not fulfilled as the first depot injection was administered to Yemisi before approval was received from the SOAD. Owing to Yemisi's known and documented history of refusing vital signs checks requiring participation, the prescribing decision took into account the expected difficulties with conducting these checks. However, there was no robust contingency plan for ensuring these checks took place, the plan itself was insufficient to accommodate Yemisi's circumstances and went no further than what is mandated in the Olanzapine policy. Yemisi received a first Olanzapine depot injection on the 13 th of November, where she also did not comply with vital signs checks requiring participation. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">There were no adverse effects noted and staff indicated following this depot injection her mental state improved somewhat.</span> Yemisi's non-compliance with vital signs checks requiring participation led to the decision being made that both depot injections would be administered relying solely on assessing Respiratory Rate and Level of Consciousness, departing from the Trust's Olanzapine depot policy. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">On the 13 th of December 2023, the plan in place was for one of the nurses on Sapphire Ward that day who had completed the Olanzapine training to both prepare and administer the injection, and as per the Olanzapine policy conduct the first set of vital signs checks, and be available for the duration of the 3 hour observations unless this responsibility is delegated to an appropriately qualified member of staff.</span> However this is not what transpired on the day. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: inadequate + administering + staff + staff">The responsibility for preparing, administering, monitoring and witnessing of these processes was unclear, and divided among multiple members of staff which did not allow for effective continuity resulting in inadequate levels of oversight.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: consent + administering + staff + staff">Yemisi did not consent to any of the staff members on Sapphire Ward that day administering the injection, and so a qualified member of staff from another ward was asked to come and assist.</span> They did not witness the preparing of the solution but were satisfied that the dose and preparation were as described. This nurse and the preparing nurse initially went to Yemisi's room to conduct pre- injection vital signs checks but those requiring participation were refused. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering
Keywords: administering">The absence of a full set of observations should have been escalated to a doctor prior to administering the depot injection, but this was not done.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">At this stage there was also a missed opportunity to reiterate potential side effects of the drug or symptoms of post-injection syndrome to Yemisi that she may have been able to flag as concerns.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">One nurse was then asked to leave the room and therefore there was a failure to follow protocol both by not having two members of staff present during the administration of the depot injection, and also that it was administered despite the requisite pre-injection vital signs checks requiring participation not taking place.</span> Following the injection, there was a total lack of clarity around responsibility and delegation of Post-injection checks, where the Nurse in Charge failed to allocate tasks consistent with safe implementation of the plan. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence was given that: (1) Olanzapine Depot injections have a known risk of Post Injection Syndrome which can lead to death. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Dispensing, administering + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication, adverse reaction + administering + staff + staff, patient">Although the risk is rare, the Trust was aware of 2 other instances of Post Injection Syndrome following the administration of some 10 Olanzapine injections in the recent past, with both individuals surviving because of early intervention by medical staff. (2) The importance of timely observations is crucial to preventing Post Injection Syndrome and preventing death in the event of an adverse reaction to the drug. (3) In order to administer an Olanzapine depot, a prescribing doctor must seek approval from a Lead Pharmacist in the Trust because the medication is a "non-formulary" medicine. (4) The trial period for administering oral medication to a patient for whom it is proposed should have a depot injection is approximately 2 weeks, whereas Yemisi only took Olanzapine tablets for 3-4 days before having her first Olazapine depot injection.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + staff + staff, patient">Therefore, she took her oral medical for less than the recommended period. (5) The requirement to obtain a second opinion from an independent doctor (SOAD) when changing medication did not happen when Yemisi was administered her first Olanzapine depot injection on 13 th November 2023. (6) In a busy psychiatric in-patient ward, staff can become distracted by having to tend to other patients, urgently, when events occur such as unexpected new patient admissions and disturbances. (7) Yemisi had a long history of refusing to take medication and refusing vital signs checks as a psychiatric in-patient.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">I am concerned that: (a) The risk of death from the use of Olanzapine depot injection needs to be made clear to patients who are going to be given that injection.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff, patient">Although it is very small risk, the fact that the risk can be largely eradicated by vital signs checks at intervals within the 3- hour period with early medical intervention, the risk needs to be stated to, and understood by, patients or those who represent their interests, before such a depot injection is given; (b) In a psychiatric in-patient setting, there are many demands on staff who can become distracted from their expected duties.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + staff + staff, patient">Unless there is a suitably qualified medical member of staff whose sole duty it is to remain in the company of a patient, who has had an Olanzapine depot injection at all times during the 3 hour post- injection observation period, there is a risk that vital signs checks will be missed and that Post Injection Syndrome will not be detected early enough if it occurs; (c) There is a risk that approval from a Lead Pharmacist to initiate a non-formulary medicine such as an Olanzapine depot can occur without the Pharmacist knowing whether a SOAD has been obtained in relation to that medication and that patient; (d) In cases where psychiatric in-patients are known to have a history of refusing vital signs checks, careful consideration and scrutiny should be given as to whether an Olanzapine depot injection is a suitable medication for such patients, especially in view of the crucial post-injection monitoring requirements. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 th January 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following.

(2) The importance of timely observations is crucial to preventing Post Injection Syndrome and preventing death in the event of an adverse reaction to the drug. (3) In order to administer an Olanzapine depot, a prescribing doctor must seek approval from a Lead Pharmacist in the Trust because the medication is a "non-formulary" medicine. (4) The trial period for administering oral medication to a patient for whom it is proposed should have a depot injection is approximately 2 weeks, whereas Yemisi only took Olanzapine tablets for 3-4 days before having her first Olazapine depot injection.</td>

Deceased name: Teresa Auriemma
Coroners name: David Reid
Coroners Area: Worcestershire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, Charles Hastings Way, Worcester WR5 1DD; 1 CORONER I am David Donald William REID, HM Senior Coroner for Worcestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 25 March 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Teresa AURIEMMA. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2024 The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">Auriemma "Died as the result of an over- prescription of supplementary potassium, due to a failure properly to monitor potassium levels in her blood.</span> Mrs. Auriemma's death was contributed to by neglect." 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In answer to the questions "when, where and how did Mrs. Auriemma come by her death?", I recorded as follows: "On 18.2.24 Teresa Auriemma was admitted to the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch after becoming unwell at home, and treated for aspiration pneumonia, dehydration and acute kidney injury, and deranged electrolytes. When reviewed in hospital on 15.3.24 she was given further intravenous potassium, a decision which was based on an out- of-date and inaccurate blood test. After the provision of that intravenous potassium, a blood test should have been carried out to check Mrs. Auriemma's potassium levels, but was not, and she was given further intravenous potassium on 16.3.24. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">She then collapsed suddenly on the ward on 17.3.24, and was confirmed deceased a short time later.</span> A blood test which had been taken very shortly before she died confirmed a fatally high level of potassium. Had Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Auriemma's potassium level been checked on 14 or 15.3.24 and again on 16.3.24, it is likely that her death would have been prevented." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1) None of the doctors caring for Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: treatment + guidance + policy + patient + guidance">Auriemma from 11.3.24 onwards appear to have heeded the guidance of policy WAHT-PHA-020 for the treatment of hypokalaemia, and in particular that daily monitoring of urea and electrolytes ( U&E ) was required until the patient's potassium levels had returned to normal levels.</span> Mrs. Auriemma had been prescribed an oral potassium supplement from 11.3.24. A junior doctor assisting the consultant on the ward round on 15.3.24, when asked what Mrs. Auriemma's potassium level was, gave the last reading taken on 11.3.24; that junior doctor appeared therefore not to have understood the need for daily U&E monitoring. The consultant accepted he should have checked the date of the reading given, but did not and instead assumed it was up-to-date. The consultant then proceeded to prescribe intravenous potassium on 15.3.24; 2) Once the intravenous potassium had been given on 15.3.24, further U&E monitoring should have been carried out before any more intravenous potassium was given. That U&E monitoring was not done, and instead further intravenous potassium was given on 16.3.24. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">No clear reason was provided to the inquest as to why the junior doctor responsible had not checked Mrs.</span> Auriemma's potassium levels before prescribing further intravenous potassium; 3) This is not the first inquest which has found shortcomings in the Trust's monitoring of patients' electrolyte levels. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Only 2 months ago, this court heard evidence in another inquest concerning the death of a young woman at Worcestershire Royal Hospital in January 2024, who had died because staff at the hospital had failed to recognize and act upon an excessively low sodium level.</span> In that case, like this, I found that there was a failure by doctors to ensure proper monitoring of electrolytes by checking blood results before prescribing IV fluids. 4) I am therefore concerned that the Trust has not ensured that its doctors: (a) understand the importance generally of U&E monitoring before prescribing intravenous fluids; and (b) are aware of, and comply with specific policies concerning this issue, such as that relating to the management of hypokalaemia ( WAHT-PHA- 020 ). 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as the Chief Executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9 January 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following: (a) [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] ( Mrs. Auriemma's daughters ); I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Rachael Ryan
Coroners name: Simon Brenchley
Coroners Area: Birmingham and Solihull
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Simon Brenchley, Assistant Coroner for Birmingham and Solihull 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachael Alicia Elizabeth RYAN. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: treatment">She was also receiving treatment from her GP for suspected cellulitis in her legs.</span> On 25th March 2024 she was readmitted to Heartlands Hospital because she was in great pain. When assessed after her admission to A and E, it was found that she now had a Category 3 pressure ulcer on her buttocks/sacral area. On 26th March tests revealed she had a deep vein thrombosis in her left leg and a scan on 27th March revealed a pulmonary embolism. Subsequently, on 5th April it was suspected that her pressure ulcer may be infected so she was started on antibiotics. A scan on 9th April revealed that she now had contracted osteomyelitis. Advice was subsequently received on 23rd April from the infectious diseases consultant that Miss Ryan needed a deep tissue biopsy in order to best inform the correct anti-biotic therapy. Despite a number of different specialities being contacted to facilitate this, the biopsy could not be carried out until 21st May at which point the most appropriate anti-biotic therapy for the particular type of infection she had was then identified and started. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Although her skin began to heal, she deteriorated on 11th June and despite continuing ongoing treatment she passed away on 21st June 2024.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">On 23 rd April Miss Ryan's treating consultant geriatrician received advice from the infectious diseases team that a deep tissue biopsy was strongly recommended to best guide the antibiotic therapy for her infection. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: between + between + team">Despite him liaising with/going back and forth between the Tissue Viability Nurse service, the Trauma and Orthopaedic team and the Plastic Surgery team (based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital) between 23 rd April and 1 st May, none of these teams could, for different reasons, facilitate this procedure.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">As a result, it was not until 2 nd May that assistance was sought from the interventional radiology team who agreed to help. 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)
Keywords: availability">The procedure was initially due to take place on 7 th May but had to be put off due to Miss Ryan being on warfarin and there were then further delays due to non-availability of the relevant specialist as well as the need to stop her existing antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours before the procedure.</span> It was finally carried out on 21 st May. 4. On 22 nd May, a new anti-biotic regime was commenced with it being noted that one of the bacterial organisms identified from the biopsy, namely Morganella morganii, was resistant to co-amoxiclav, the antibiotic which Miss Ryan had most recently been receiving from 15 th April until 19 th May. 5. Although I heard evidence that the delay in starting the new antibiotic regime was unlikely to have altered the sad outcome in this case in part due to Miss Ryan's existing frailty and poor prognosis, I am concerned that in the absence of any existing protocol regarding the correct specialism for the biopsy procedure, no Multi-disciplinary meeting bringing together specialists from the different disciplines was offered or held in this case to agree the best way forward. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">This led to a delay and a lack of collaboration between teams which could, if repeated, result in an avoidable death. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 January 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: FAMILY OF MISS RYAN I have also sent it to the Medical Examiner, who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Susan Dear
Coroners name: Hannah Godfrey
Coroners Area: Berkshire
Category: Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | NHS England
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 2.</span> NHS ENGLAND 1 CORONER I am Hannah Godfrey Area Coroner for the coroner area of Berkshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. A prevention of future deaths report raises issues and is a recommendation that action should be taken but does not recommend what that action should be. That is a matter for the recipient. It is important to note the case of R (Dr Siddiqui and Dr Paeprer-Rohricht) v Assistant Coroner for East London . <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: safety + information">This case clarifies that the issuing and receipt of a Regulation 28 report entails no more than the coroner bringing some information regarding a public safety concern to the attention of the recipient.</span> The report is not punitive in nature and engages no civil or criminal right or obligation on the part of the recipient, other than the obligation to respond to the report in writing within 56 days. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 May 2024 I opened an inquest into the death of Mrs Susan Dear on 4 January 2023 aged 72. The inquest concluded on 9 September 2024. The family requested that I refer to Mrs Dear as Susan, which this report will reflect. The conclusion of the inquest was that Susan had died of natural causes (Pulmonary Embolism due to underlying Deep Vein Thrombosis). 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Susan was suffering abdominal pain, and her family called 999 at 10.20 pm on 3 January and that call was triaged at category 3 (meaning that an ambulance was expected to be on scene within 120 minutes). At that time the inquest heard that there were 48 patients awaiting ambulances, 7 were waiting for category 2 ambulances with the longest wait time being 1 hour 12 minutes, 19 patients were waiting for category 3 ambulances with the longest wait time being 7 hour 55 minutes. Susan's symptoms deteriorated and a second 999 call made at 2.32 on 4 January was triaged at category 2 (meaning that an ambulance was expected to be on scene within 40 minutes). At that time the area was in OPEL 4, the highest OPEL level, indicating Extreme Pressure on resources. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow
Keywords: waiting time">There were 37 patients waiting for ambulances. 9 patients were awaiting category 2 ambulances with the longest wait being 5 hours 53 minutes, and 26 patients were awaiting Category 3 ambulances, with the longest waiting time being 14 hours 39 minutes.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: resource">There was no ambulance resource available to respond at any time to Susan.</span> At around 5 am Susan's family decided they could wait no longer and drove her to hospital, where she was recognised as deceased shortly after arrival at 6.02 am. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence at inquest I did not find that the ambulance delay contributed to Susan's death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT is BEING SENT TO: Royal College of Pathologists Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Chief Midwife Southwest Regional Midwife University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Dr Simon Fox KC, Assistant Coroner for Area of Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 th April 2023 1 commenced an investigation into the death of Lisa Gale. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 th November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Lisa developed a rare but serious condition of pregnancy Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP). She attended hospital promptly and cooperated fully with the medical advice she received. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Assessment, investigation, testing, screening (e.g., holistic review) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: laboratory + treatment + conditions + laboratory + staff + staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - (1) Blood was taken for liver function tests (LFTs) on admission before her condition was diagnosed; (2) Lisa's LFT's were grossly elevated (normal range in brackets) ALT 612 (10-50), bilirubin 122 (<21), creatinine 168 (45-84); (3) This was due to a potentially fatal condition Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy — from which she subsequently died; (4) Despite being grossly elevated, the results once obtained in the laboratory were not phoned through by the laboratory staff to the clinical staff; (5) This was because the Royal College of Pathologists' guidelines for urgent reporting only provides for the same with levels above 750 for ALT, 300 for bilirubin and 354 for creatinine and does not provide for different reporting levels for those taken in pregnant women; (6) This is despite pregnancy specific conditions such as AFLP being potentially fatal at much lower levels of abnormal LFTs than those set currently by the Royal College of Pathologists; (7) As a result there was a delay in diagnosing her AFLP and starting appropriate treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 th January 2025. l, the coroner, may extend the period.</span> Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the chief coroner and to the following interested persons — a) Lisa's family; b) University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. I have also sent it to [REDACTED] (Consultant Obstetrician) and [REDACTED] (Director of Midwifery and Nursing for Women's Services) at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the chief coroner a copy of your response. The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: NHS England The Chief Executive of George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust UK Kidney Association British Transplant Society Renal Association 1 CORONER : I am Linda Lee, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS : I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulation 28 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST : On 9 January 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of John Frederick Doyle, who died on the 30 December 2023 aged 60. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 November 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + patient">The conclusion was: 1a Multiple Organ Failure 1b Cytomegalovirus Infection 1c Chronic kidney disease (unknown aetiology, kidney transplant in 2022) II Hypertension Natural causes against a background of missed opportunities to diagnose and treat cytomegalovirus infection, together with the impact of the resident (formerly junior) doctors' strike on the provision of consistent patient care. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH : In March 2022, John underwent a kidney transplant at Manchester Royal Infirmary and subsequently received follow-up care and regular reviews at the Royal Derby Hospital (RDH).</span> He was first admitted to George Eliot Hospital (GEH) on 2 December 2023, presenting with rectal bleeding and a persistent cough. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

Keywords: treatment">As a result, GEH relied on telephone consultations with specialist hospitals for advice on investigations and treatment for renal-related issues.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: treatment + guidance + guidance + team">During John's treatment, the team at GEH sought guidance from both RDH and University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW), the latter being the nearest specialist centre.</span> Following John's admission, tests were ordered to rule out cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. However, without receiving these test results, John was discharged on 6 December, despite evidence suggesting he was still very unwell. He was re-admitted via emergency ambulance on 8 December. Unsuccessful attempts were made to test for the presence of CMV during his stay at GEH. John's condition continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to UHCW on 21 December. A diagnosis was not made until 28 December, when tests showed he had 27 million copies of CMV per milliliter of blood, an extremely high count. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Treatment with ganciclovir and anti-CMV immunoglobulin was commenced.</span> By this stage, it is likely that John had developed CMV encephalitis. He was intubated and ventilated, but his condition declined, leading to multiple organ failure. John died on 30 December 2023. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mortality + patient">Evidence was received that whilst CMV rarely causes more than cold or flu-like symptoms in the general population, it is one of the most common infectious complications of solid organ transplantation and is reported to increase graft loss and patient mortality.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">It was acknowledged that an earlier diagnosis and treatment of CMV could have potentially changed the outcome for John and would have increased the likelihood of successful treatment.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: conditions, higher + patient">Consultants from both hospitals testified that, due to the junior doctors' strike, they had to assume additional responsibilities and manage a higher patient load, which affected their ability to maintain a consistent overview of patients' conditions and treatments.</span> In John's case, the impact was the failure to notice that the test results had not been received at both GEH and UHCW. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Assessment, investigation, testing, screening (e.g., holistic review) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: sample, laboratory, collection + safety + care + sample, laboratory + patient">The patient safety incident investigation by GEH identified human error and systemic issues in handling CMV testing and the care of renal patients: Sample Collection Errors : Multiple errors were identified in sample collection for CMV testing: The laboratory operated by UHCW failed to freeze one sample and one sample was incorrectly rejected as unusable Clinicians used the wrong tubes, failing to use the necessary, purple-topped tube that prevents the blood collected from clotting.</span> Human error led to prompts for correct tube selection being ignored and the use of paper labelling did not prompt the use of the correct tube. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

Keywords: patient transfer + patient">GEH/UHCW lacked the protocols for timely patient transfer.</span> The report also recommended that patients who are at risk of transplant failure should be managed proactively. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: clear + patient">Evidence given at the inquest showed there is currently no clear protocol at GEH regarding which hospital to contact for advice or when a patient should be considered for transfer to a specialist unit.</span> Additionally, it was unclear whether the transfer should be initiated by the specialist centre or by GEH. Evidence was received that some training had been delivered on the correct procedure regarding sampling and that draft protocols were being drawn up but were not yet finalised or published. None of the consultants from GEH who gave evidence had expertise in renal medicine or experience with transplant patients. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: care + guidance + guidance">Additionally, although it was planned to develop guidance, only the renal consultant at UHCW was familiar with the Renal Association and the British Transplantation Society's guidelines, specifically the ‘Clinical Practice Guideline Post-Operative Care in the Kidney Transplant Recipient'.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: care + guidance + guidance">This guidance states: " This document is intended for those engaged in the care of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) who are non-experts.</span> With increasing efforts to deliver healthcare locally, many renal transplant recipients are followed up in centres remote from the main surgical transplant unit. At the same time, transplantation medicine has evolved into an increasingly complex and specialised field of nephrology. The following guidelines reflect this alteration in clinical practice and are intended for those healthcare professionals who look after renal transplant patients. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: care">They are also intended to be useful to both medical and surgical trainees, general practitioners, nurse specialists and other associated healthcare professionals involved in the care of renal transplant patients. " It was noted that the guideline aims to inform and support non-experts caring for transplant patients, not to replace assistance from specialist centres.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + between + between">It does not appear that there is any specialist guidelines or examples of best practice regarding collaborative ways of working between specialist and non-specialist centres. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS : During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

The conclusion of the inquest was that Alison died due to misadventure. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">The Medical Cause of Death was: 1 (a) Hypoxic / Ischemic Brain Injury (b) Compression of neck by ligature 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Alison had a long history of mental health difficulties and a formal diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder on a background of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">At the time of her death Alison was residing in a residential home which offered specialist support for those with enduring mental health illness.</span> She was supported in the home and received psychological therapy. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: mental health">Alison was content with her living arrangements but in June 2019 a decision was made that her mental health had stabilised and that she would therefore be moving to step-down accommodation at some point in the near future.</span> As part of her condition, Alison regularly engaged in acts of self-harm which included episodes of ligation. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: staff">Against that background, on the evening of 11 th September 2019 a staff member went to check on Alison and and found her unresponsive on her bed [REDACTED].</span> An ambulance was called and Alison was taken to hospital where early CT scans showed a suspected hypoxic brain injury. Over the course of the following day Alison's physiological condition continued to deteriorate and tests confirmed death by neurological criteria. She sadly died on the 13th September 2019. The court heard evidence that at the time of her death Alison was experiencing several stressors that were causing her anxiety and making her urges to self-harm stronger. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">This included anxiety about the move from her residential placement and concerns around her benefit entitlements.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: concerns + factors">It is likely that these factors acted as triggers for the self-harm episode that led to her death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: communication + care + needs + care + care + between">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The court heard evidence from the Adult Social Care Team that communication with service users around moving accommodation needs to be managed carefully as false assurances can undermine trust between the service user and the supporting team.</span> The court further heard that uncertainty can be a potential stressor or trigger for self-harm for those with a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: communication">There is an inherent uncertainty in the timescales for moving as it depends on the availability of suitable accommodation and the situation therefore requires careful management and communication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Whilst consideration had been given to conversations with the service user in this situation, the court heard evidence from those supporting Alison (including community mental health nurses) that they were unclear on the stage the process had reached, the specific steps of the process and the likely timescales involved.</span> This affected the type of support they could provide. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor
Keywords: policy">There was a lack of evidence of a specific approach or policy addressing how the process can be clearly communicated to those supporting service users in the community.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">Further, no internal review was carried out at Leicestershire County Council following Alison's death.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: inadequate">If such reviews are not conducted this could lead to inadequate learning from deaths which creates a risk of further deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 06, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Deceased name: Anne Taylor
Coroners name: Michael Pemberton

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: SALFORD ROYAL HOSPITAL FOUNDATION TRUST | NHS ENGLAND
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 SALFORD ROYAL HOSPITAL FOUNDATION TRUST 2 NHS ENGLAND 1 CORONER I am Michael James Pemberton, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester (West). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 August 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anne Taylor aged 95. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Accident, and the medical cause of death was Traumatic Intracranial Haemorrhage. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 17 July 2024, the deceased was on a short holiday break in Blackpool at a hotel with her son sharing a twin room. In the late evening, she banged her head on a bedside cabinet as she turned in bed and then fell out of the bed. She got back into bed, with no complaint of injury. She appeared fine on the following day with no complaints of feeling unwell and spent the day undertaking activities. The planned holiday break ended the day after on Friday 19 July 2024 and she returned home. At 18:30 on 19 July she telephoned her daughter and said she did not feel well. Her son and daughter went to her home and found she had slurred speech. An ambulance was called and she was conveyed to Salford Royal Hospital. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: waiting time + time">During a wait to be seen the deceased became agitated and elected to leave the hospital prior to being assessed after being told of the likely waiting time.</span> It was planned that she would return the following morning when the emergency department was less busy. She returned to hospital on 20 July via ambulance and was assessed. A CT scan found she had suffered a traumatic brain injury with bilateral acute subdural bleed and midline shift. Neurosurgical advice deemed her not fit for acute surgery and she was treated medically, deteriorating over the next week. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During evidence, it was heard that the deceased had elected to leave the Hospital on Friday 19 July because of waiting times, before being clinically assessed. 2. <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: waiting time + time">There was no consideration of whether secondary investigations could be undertaken during the waiting time for example CT scan which would likely be required by a clinician in order to make a diagnosis. 3.</span> No evidence was provided that the deceased's capacity to decide to leave the hospital was assessed given the history of suspected head injury. 4. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">Reference was made to a new standard operating procedure being developed relating to patients leaving the hospital before a clinical assessment occurs, but it was unclear what this will include. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3 January 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28: REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], President Royal, Royal College of General Practitioners, 30 Euston Square, London, NW1 2FB [REDACTED], President of the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health, 5-11 Theobalds Road, London, WC1H 8SH [REDACTED], President of the Royal College of Surgeons, 35-43 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PE [REDACTED], President of the Royal College of Radiologists, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JW 1 CORONER I am Dr Julian Morris, senior coroner, for the coroner area of London Inner South 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18.6.2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lacey May Brookman, aged 11. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11.10.2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH That narrative conclusion summarises the events as follows: Lacey was 11 when she had suffered over a week of varying abdominal pains associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation and low-grade fever. After approx. 10 days her mother had a telephone consultation with her GP. Some of her symptoms appeared to be settling and it was determined she had been/was suffering from a viral illness. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">She was given safety netting advice.</span> Three days later she re-presented to another GP at the same practice who considered she had appendicitis; she was transferred to hospital. There she was seen by A&E and surgical doctors. The registrar did not consider she had appendicitis but perhaps another diagnosis and arranged for her to be reviewed on the ward later the same day. She went home in the interim at about 0200 (24/4//2021). The consultant reviewed her later that day and considered she was unwell but could not reach a diagnosis. He arranged for an urgent abdominal ultrasound, +/- CT scan. Those investigations revealed a retrocaecal, perforated appendix with abscess formation and right sided hydronephrosis. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">The evidence was that the appendix had likely perforated before the original GP telephone review (20/4/2021).</span> Lacey was transferred to a specialist paediatric unit for operation the following day (25/4/2021) but developed a duodenal ulcer and coagulopathy as a result of her condition. The appendix was removed but Lacey had an extremely stormy post-operative period. That post operative period included further operations, leaving her abdomen open, on-going coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation and ultimately widespread multiorgan failure. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)
Keywords: availability">Despite the input of 2 further hospitals, she did not survive and died on 4/6/2021 at 17.25hrs The Inquest also heard expert evidence from a Consultant Paediatric Surgeon who explained that (1) Acute Retrocaecal appendicitis occurs in about one-third of acute appendicitis presentations (2) that it is difficult to determine as its presentation is not ‘classical' in terms of right sided abdominal pain and presenting symptoms (3) it therefore often presents late and following perforation and with complications already present, and (4) the availability of abdominal ultrasound +/- CT scan is therefore critical in diagnosing its presentation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: staff">However, from the evidence I heard in court, I do not consider there is sufficient knowledge and awareness and therefore consideration from junior staff in relation to this particular type of presentation of acute appendicitis.</span> In addition, the importance of carrying out an abdominal ultrasound (+/- CT) was highlighted. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)
Keywords: concerns + availability">The evidence was that this could only be provided by the on-call radiologist, which therefore restricted its availability and assistance in making the diagnosis. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. Neither the original GP, the reviewing surgical SHO or surgical registrar considered that Lacey had appendicitis. The Consultant surgeon reviewing Lacey on the 24 th , considered she was ill but could not reach a diagnosis. 2. Despite the slant of available literature, it was evident retrocaecal appendicitis presentation is not a rare presentation of either acute appendicitis or generalised abdominal pain (both common presenting features in the young) 3. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres) + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] James Paget Hospital King's College Hospital Addenbrooks [and to the to all safeguarding boards in Norfolk, Cambridge and covering Kings (where the deceased was under 18)]. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
