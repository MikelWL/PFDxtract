REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] Secretary of State for the Home Department Home Office 2 Masham Street LONDON SW1P 4DF 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy W Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST An Investigation into the death commenced on the 8th of January 2021 and an Inquest heard before me on the 2nd of December 2022 that concluded the Investigation.</span> The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a [REDACTED] toxicity I returned a narrative conclusion that Chantelle Williams died as the consequence an unknown quantity of recently self-administered [REDACTED] in circumstances where her intentions remain unclear. Reporting restrictions were imposed in this case because of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America, the case being one of a cluster of eight similar cases upon the Greater Manchester West jurisdiction.

Keywords: staff + staff + presumed">Healthcare staff were aware of the deceased's ongoing possession of [REDACTED] and the high risk of self-harm with significant risk of deliberate or inadvertent overdose and her presumed or known possession of [REDACTED] was managed conservatively by reason of the deceased's status as a voluntary inpatient who had been continually assessed to have capacity.</span> On the 29th of May 2020 at approximately 6.45am the deceased was observed in her room on Keats Ward in a collapsed, unresponsive and cyanosed condition. She was being observed hourly and had last been seen alive at about 6am. An immediate ‘crash call' was made but she failed to respond to attempted resuscitation and was verified as dead at 7.20am that morning. Post-mortem samples from the deceased revealed the presence of fatally toxic levels of both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], likely from a single batch of [REDACTED] the deceased had previously sourced, retained and hidden. The evidence does not establish the precise quantity or time she ingested the [REDACTED] but was analysed to be at levels that would rapidly, within minutes, precipitate unconsciousness, hypoxia and cardio-respiratory failure. The deceased had, incidentally, been properly prescribed promethazine - a sedating antihistamine to assist her sleep, that would also have produced an antiemetic effect. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Police recovered no note or evidence of her intentions and were able to establish no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. [REDACTED] is a reportable poison as well as a reportable explosives precursor within the terms, meaning and effect of Part 4 of Schedule 1A of the Poisons Act 1972 with the consequence that: a. The Poisons Act 1972 sets out the legal obligations in relation to the sale, purchase, and use of these chemicals for suppliers, professional users and members of the public. b. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education
Keywords: guidance + guidance + training">The published Guidance (commenced in 2014 and updated in August 2024) does not give specific guidance or suggested training to sellers, particularly [REDACTED] acquired by members of the public, particularly over ‘online marketplaces' in circumstances of the purchase on a ‘one off' basis for the means of self-harming. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: presumed">Whilst there is a legal duty on persons selling this substance to report "suspicious" transactions within 24 hours to the Home Office, the purchase of small quantities is being presumed to be connected to the many legitimate uses of the substance (such as food preservation, fertilizer etc) rather than in fact, being evaluated as a member of the public seeking purchase of modest quantities used as their chosen means by which to end life. d.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">The current Home Office guidance and supporting video, leaflet and posters do not reference [REDACTED] as a specific example of concern and focuses on the phenomenon of ‘malicious' misuse and not deliberate misuse in the sense of suicide/self-harm. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: national">The police investigation into one UK based source of supply revealed in 247 cases separate supplies of 500 grams of less of [REDACTED] to customers in the UK and Europe, police established that 85 of these individuals who were traceable had either died as the consequence of self-ingestion of the substance, or had purchased it with a view to having the means to use this method to end their life in circumstances where: a. the vendors of the [REDACTED] were not aware of this potential misuse of the substance. b. the small quantities being purchased had been incorrectly evaluated to be an increase in individuals pursuing recreational home-curing/food preservations as a hobby, being an artefact of ‘lockdown' living following the COVID national pandemic emergency. c.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">Vendors were unaware that their website/details were being distributed as part of internet information platforms designed to aid, abet, assist or promote suicide methods. d.</span> From the specific example of 247 supplies in a 12-month period, police established that 45 purchasers were confirmed as deceased (these deaths were in relation to supplies to UK customers and purchasers from abroad) and only 15 purchases were confirmed to have taken place for legitimate purposes (meat curing etc.). 3. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: access + information">The police investigation revealed the ability of members of the public to access a number of websites, primarily created in the USA, Canada and Mexico that promoted information as to how to access: a.</span> Poisons that could bring about death b. How, in what way and with other necessary preparations (in particular -antiemetic medications) the poisons should be administered. c. Sourcing such poisons/chemicals/medications in the UK and abroad. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 16, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons 1.

On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

Keywords: between + between">Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall.</span> The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46. On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: concerns">At 00:33 a member of Kaine's family called the police to report their concerns.</span> A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle. During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: ambulance">Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance.</span> He arrived at 03:47. Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: between + between">Lack of agreed joint agency policy between EMAS and the police on s.136 MHA 1983 detentions I issued a PFD on 17 July 2025, part way through the final inquest hearing, to raise my concern over the apparent confusion with both the police and EMAS as to the applicable joint agency policy dealing with s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance.</span> Since that PFD was issued, the evidence has developed and the position at the end of the inquest was as follows: - The police confirmed that the document titled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" has been ratified within their organisation and continues to remain the relevant joint-agency policy for s.136 detention and conveyance. This policy has been implemented for the police since its inception. - EMAS cannot confirm whether the above policy has been ratified in its current version within the organisation. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">They have confirmed that an employee at EMAS signed off on the 2021 version, but that this information was never disseminated within the organisation because the finalised version of the policy remained within that employee's email inbox.</span> The consequence appears to be that EMAS has never implemented this policy, rather they have been working to an internal policy for Mental Health Conveyance that contains different working standards. Acknowledging that there is no confusion for the police as to the relevant policy, and that they do consider that it has been implemented, I remain concerned. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: between + between">For a policy to be effective, all purported parties to that policy need to know it applies to them. - Internal disorganisation within EMAS has culminated in a situation where, even after a period of investigation between 17 July - 25 July, they are unable to tell the Court which, if any, joint agency policy applies to them.</span> They are unable to tell the Court whether they are still part of the relevant working group. EMAS have allowed a situation to perpetuate in which they appear, on the face of the policy documents, to be party to an agreement (which includes service level agreements for conveyance) when they simply do not know if this is correct. The upshot of this is that other agencies may be placing reliance on the conveyance terms within the policy when they are dealing with s.136 detention. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The medical cause of death was 1a Hanging. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest On 20th November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED].

Keywords: mental health + access, quality + communication + higher + between, staff + between, staff + mental health + training + training + training + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments. (2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Patryk's next of kin. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Priya Malhotra 18 July 2025

(2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</td>
