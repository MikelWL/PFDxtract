Deceased name: Joanne Stones
Coroners name: Gillian Kane

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: York & Scarborough NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1, PSIR - York & Scarborough NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Gillian KANE, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of North Yorkshire and York 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 29 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joanne Louise STONES aged 53. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was that: Joanne Louise Stones died on the 17th of September 2023 at Scarborough Hospital, Woodlands Drive, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, YO12 6QL, after being admitted for abdominal pain and ultimately being diagnosed with acute cholecystitis with gallstones against a background of Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome and Addison's Disease. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Joanne Louise Stones (‘Joanne') was a 53-year-old lady with a complex medical history.</span> Joanne had a medical condition called Anti Phospholipid Syndrome [APS]. In 2021 Joanne experienced Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) which led to Addison's Disease (AD). <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">As a result of this Joanne's body could not produce cortisol and she required lifelong steroid treatment with Hydrocortisone.</span> If Joanne had an infection, she needed her hydrocortisone level to be recalibrated to manage it. On the 10th of September 2023, Joanne was taken by ambulance to hospital where she was given a provisional diagnosis of suspected gallstones and discharged home with oral antibiotics and analgesia. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">Her medical notes showed that those treating her were aware that her medical history included the diagnoses of APS and AD.</span> On the 13th of September 2023, Joanne attended the hospital again for a planned ultrasound and was diagnosed with Acute Cholecystitis with gallstones. She was discharged home and advised to complete the course of antibiotics she had previously been given. On the 16th of September 2023, Joanne was ‘blue lighted' to hospital with suspected Cholecystitis. The hospital was ‘pre-alerted' ahead of her arrival as paramedics were concerned about her condition. Joanne was received into the First Assessment Area and there was a delay of over 2 hours before she was moved to Resus. There was a delay in administering intravenous antibiotics and fluids leading to Joanne developing hypoglycaemia. There was substantial delay before it was recognised that Joanne had AD and she required steroids. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Joanne's condition deteriorated rapidly and she was transferred to intensive care where she died on the 17th of September 2023.</span> I found during the course of the inquest that there were delays in recognising and appropriately treating Joanne's condition. I was unable to determine on the balance of probabilities that these caused or more than minimally contributed to her death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: treatment + concerns">However, there was evidence of omissions and delays in the treatment that Joanne received which caused me concern. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) (1) The ambulance service pre-alerted the hospital regarding Joanne's serious condition but this did not result in her being prioritised and placed in Resus on arrival. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">Joanne was wearing two medic alert bracelets to draw attention to her diagnoses of APS and AD but these were not observed by the treating team.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: team">There were no visible 'red flags' on Joanne's medical records, highlighting her APS and AD diagnoses to the treating team.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: conditions + patient + patient">The treating doctor relied on a very sick patient to confirm any underlying medical conditions.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + clear + conditions + staff + staff">There was no liaison with Rheumatology, who had extensive knowledge and experience of Joanne and how to treat her conditions. (2) There was delay in Joanne receiving fluids, which led to hypoglycaemia which was then not treated promptly. (3) It was not clear from the medical notes that staff treating Joanne had considered the relevance of her APS and AD in her treatment plan. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 24, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I have also sent it to DHSC who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 30/07/2025 Gillian KANE Assistant Coroner for North Yorkshire and York</span>

I made a narrative determination, which I attach. I concluded that the medical cause of death was 1a sepsis 1b Escherichia coli bacteraemia. 1c antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis with Rt pelvicalyceal dilatation on prenatal ultrasound 2. nil recorded I gave a brief narrative conclusion as follows: Oscar died following sepsis caused by an underlying naturally occurring e-coli infection. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">At the time Oscar was not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Oscar was born on 27 May 2024 with a pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO).</span> An anomaly that was first seen on antenatal scanning. He remained well after a short course of antibiotics and was discharged home. Th inquest heard that antibiotics were to have been restarted but this did not happen. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: sensitive">On 26 June 2024 Oscar's condition deteriorated rapidly and catastrophically following a bacterial infection that was sensitive to the prescribed (but not received) antibiotics.</span> A call was made to the 111 at 05.31 on 26 June 2024 reporting that Oscar was having breathing difficulties. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: situation">The call handlers who use the algorithms are non-clinical and cannot identify a more urgent situation by asking the right questions of the caller.</span> Also, the algorithm does not appear to assist in early identification of a serious problem in a newborn. A GP was asked to call back within the hour which occurred and after questioning the family, the GP instructed the parents to take Oscar immediately to the nearest ED (John Radcliffe). The GP then pre-alerted the hospital. Oscar was found to have sepsis and this led to his death in hospital that same day. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

This report is being sent to: His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Director General Chief Executive of His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service 1 CORONER I am Ian Brownhill, Assistant Coroner for Kent and Medway. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 November 2021 an investigation commenced into the death of Azroy DAWES-CLARKE. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: factors">The jury returned a narrative conclusion which read: "From hearing all the evidence presented to us, we conclude that Azroy Dawes-Clarke died from a combination of factors beginning with the compression of the neck via self-inflicted ligaturing.</span> This was followed by a disproportionate use of force by prison officers during control and restraint which led to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: staff + staff">From the body-worn footage, it is evident that prison staff neglected to consider Mr Dawes-Clarke's head positioning and breathing throughout the restraint.</span> The poor practice of applying handcuffs while Mr Dawes-Clarke was in a kneeling position more than minimally increased the risk of positional asphyxia." The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury due to cardio-respiratory arrest in close temporal proximity to a period of third party restraint shortly after apparent seizure like activity following compression of the neck by a ligature 1b 1c 1d II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Azroy Dawes-Clarke died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 10 November 2021. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mental health + communication + care + between + between">The jury who heard the case, recorded that, " prior to the 10th November and on the day of Mr Dawes-Clarke's passing, there was a lack of communication between all parties involved with regards to Mr Dawes-Clarke's physical and mental health." Mr Dawes-Clarke had ligatured in both the houseblock, and in the separation and care unit of HMP Elmley, prior to the date of his death.</span> A decision was made to move Mr Dawes-Clarke to the inpatient department of HMP Elmley. Mr Dawes-Clarke was placed in a safer cell with no ligature points. He [REDACTED] applied a ligature to his neck, self-strangulating. The jury recorded, " Mr Dawes-Clarke did not intend to end his own life when he used the ligature on the 10th November. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: listened + staff + staff + mechanism + mechanism">Rather, ligaturing was a known coping mechanism of Mr Dawes-Clarke, which he would use in order to be listened to." A member of healthcare staff saw him self-strangulating.</span> Officers entered the cell and removed the ligature. A, "code blue" was called, which automatically caused an ambulance to be called to the prison. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + staff + staff">Prison healthcare staff, including two general practitioners working within the prison at the time were able to attend the cell and stabilise Mr Dawes-Clarke.</span> Paramedics attended the inpatient department and made the decision to convey Mr Dawes-Clarke to hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The prison healthcare staff, including the general practitioners then left the area.</span> The general practitioners provided a handover to the paramedics and left the prison it being the end of their shift and nobody asking them to stay. Mr Dawes-Clarke had been wearing an anti-ligature gown. This left him exposed, a decision was made to clothe him. Whilst efforts were made to clothe Mr Dawes-Clarke, it was suggested that he had kicked one of the paramedics, who then left the cell. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The jury went on to record: "For Mr Dawes-Clarke's conveyance to hospital, it was appropriate to attempt to clothe him.</span> However, it was inappropriate to persevere with clothing attempts. The decision making model should have been utilised, and attempts to clothe him should have stopped at the point of resistance. Following the initiation of restraint against Mr Dawes-Clarke, the continued restraint escalated unnecessarily. The prolonged restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke was inappropriate and disproportionate." During the restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke, the paramedics were not in the cell. Prison healthcare were not in the cell either. The jury recorded: "The considerable delay in contacting healthcare to attend throughout the restraint, and furthermore the delay in raising the general alarm caused a significant hindrance. Prison officers were not able to receive vital medical advice for carrying out the restraint. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">This demonstrates that the lack of healthcare throughout the restraint was a failure and not in line with prison guidance.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: care">The ability of the paramedics to perform their duty of care to Mr Dawes-Clarke during the restraint was limited by their placement and lack of visibility from outside the cell.</span> Furthermore, it was inappropriate for the paramedics to approve the handcuffing of Mr Dawes-Clarke having had no training in mechanical restraint to give such advice." Mr Dawes-Clarke was handcuffed (something which the jury found to be inappropriate considering his positioning) and he went limp and became unresponsive. Mr Dawes-Clarke had a cardiac and respiratory arrest. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record, attendance">The jury went on to record: "There were significant shortcomings from both the paramedics and prison officers in attendance in their responses to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp and unresponsive.</span> Specifically, the delay in establishing whether he was breathing and the inaction and further delay when starting CPR. Throughout the whole incident, there was a failure on all parts to communicate effectively and properly. This includes the way in which emergency calls have to be relayed through the communications systems in prison." Paramedics did re-enter the cell after a member of prison healthcare (a registered general nurse) attended. Treatment was given and there was a return of spontaneous circulation. Mr Dawes-Clarke was conveyed to Medway Maritime Hospital, having arrested again whilst being taken there. In the emergency department he became asystole and despite efforts at treating him, he died there. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + care + staff + staff">The jury found that, "the level of understanding and care from the prison staff was grossly insufficient." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: material">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Despite being in a safer cell, dressed in an anti-ligature gown, Mr Dawes-Clarke was able to make a ligature from the bedding material in his cell.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: respect + material">The material from which the mattress and pillow cover are made, permit strips to be ripped from them. (2) Officers involved in Mr Dawes-Clarke's ACCT process, described different experiences, familiarity and training in respect of the ACCT process.</span> Some described finding new ACCT paperwork as difficult, others were unclear as to what matters should be recorded within the ACCT paperwork. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Capacity to provide training to frontline officers and other civilian staff within the prison appeared to be limited. (3) Officers who were present during Mr Dawes-Clarke's cardio-respiratory arrest had different training with regard to first aid and basic life support.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard that whilst all uniformed prison officers would have regular training in respect of control and restraint, not all had recent (if any) training in first aid or basic life support.</span> Some of the officers who gave evidence were unclear as to the correct response to a cardio respiratory arrest during physical restraint. (4) Whilst the use of force paperwork completed following Mr Dawes-Clarke's physical restraint made mention of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, none of the officers (including the individual who completed the paperwork) appeared to have any basic understanding of the circumstances when the Mental Capacity Act may apply in a custodial setting. Equally, many were unclear as to what their role would be in conveying a prisoner who lacked the capacity to consent to their conveyance to hospital in a medical emergency. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect

Keywords: respect + care">Answers in respect of the legal framework which applied when prison officers are involved in care and treatment of a prisoner (the particular issue in the present case being the conveyance to hospital and the decision to dress him) were inconsistent or incomplete. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as the Director General Chief Executive of His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

This report is being sent to: HMP Elmley | South East Coast Ambulance Service | Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Governing Governor of HMP Elmley; The Chief Executive of South East Coast Ambulance Service; and The Chief Executive of Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Ian Brownhill, Assistant Coroner for Kent and Medway. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 November 2021 an investigation commenced into the death of Azroy DAWES-CLARKE. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: factors">The jury returned a narrative conclusion which read: "From hearing all the evidence presented to us, we conclude that Azroy Dawes-Clarke died from a combination of factors beginning with the compression of the neck via self-inflicted ligaturing.</span> This was followed by a disproportionate use of force by prison officers during control and restraint which led to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">After restraint, there was insufficient action taken by prison staff and paramedics upon realising Mr Dawes-Clarke's cardiac and respiratory arrest.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">From the body-worn footage, it is evident that prison staff neglected to consider Mr Dawes-Clarke's head positioning and breathing throughout the restraint.</span> The poor practice of applying handcuffs while Mr Dawes-Clarke was in a kneeling position more than minimally increased the risk of positional asphyxia." The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury due to cardio-respiratory arrest in close temporal proximity to a period of third party restraint shortly after apparent seizure like activity following compression of the neck by a ligature 1b 1c 1d II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Azroy Dawes-Clarke died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 10 November 2021. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mental health + communication + care + between + between">The jury who heard the case, recorded that, " prior to the 10th November and on the day of Mr Dawes-Clarke's passing, there was a lack of communication between all parties involved with regards to Mr Dawes-Clarke's physical and mental health." Mr Dawes-Clarke had ligatured in both the houseblock, and in the separation and care unit of HMP Elmley, prior to the date of his death.</span> A decision was made to move Mr Dawes-Clarke to the inpatient department of HMP Elmley. Mr Dawes-Clarke was placed in a safer cell with no ligature points. He [REDACTED] applied a ligature to his neck, self-strangulating. The jury recorded, " Mr Dawes-Clarke did not intend to end his own life when he used the ligature on the 10th November. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: listened + staff + staff + mechanism + mechanism">Rather, ligaturing was a known coping mechanism of Mr Dawes-Clarke, which he would use in order to be listened to." A member of healthcare staff saw him self-strangulating.</span> Officers entered the cell and removed the ligature. A, "code blue" was called, which automatically caused an ambulance to be called to the prison. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + staff + staff">Prison healthcare staff, including two general practitioners working within the prison at the time were able to attend the cell and stabilise Mr Dawes-Clarke.</span> Paramedics attended the inpatient department and made the decision to convey Mr Dawes-Clarke to hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The prison healthcare staff, including the general practitioners then left the area.</span> The general practitioners provided a handover to the paramedics and left the prison it being the end of their shift and nobody asking them to stay. Mr Dawes-Clarke had been wearing an anti-ligature gown. This left him exposed, a decision was made to clothe him. Whilst efforts were made to clothe Mr Dawes-Clarke, it was suggested that he had kicked one of the paramedics, who then left the cell. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The jury went on to record: "For Mr Dawes-Clarke's conveyance to hospital, it was appropriate to attempt to clothe him.</span> However, it was inappropriate to persevere with clothing attempts. The decision making model should have been utilised, and attempts to clothe him should have stopped at the point of resistance. Following the initiation of restraint against Mr Dawes-Clarke, the continued restraint escalated unnecessarily. The prolonged restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke was inappropriate and disproportionate." During the restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke, the paramedics were not in the cell. Prison healthcare were not in the cell either. The jury recorded: "The considerable delay in contacting healthcare to attend throughout the restraint, and furthermore the delay in raising the general alarm caused a significant hindrance. Prison officers were not able to receive vital medical advice for carrying out the restraint. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: care">The ability of the paramedics to perform their duty of care to Mr Dawes-Clarke during the restraint was limited by their placement and lack of visibility from outside the cell.</span> Furthermore, it was inappropriate for the paramedics to approve the handcuffing of Mr Dawes-Clarke having had no training in mechanical restraint to give such advice." Mr Dawes-Clarke was handcuffed (something which the jury found to be inappropriate considering his positioning) and he went limp and became unresponsive. Mr Dawes-Clarke had a cardiac and respiratory arrest. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record, attendance">The jury went on to record: "There were significant shortcomings from both the paramedics and prison officers in attendance in their responses to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp and unresponsive.</span> Specifically, the delay in establishing whether he was breathing and the inaction and further delay when starting CPR. Throughout the whole incident, there was a failure on all parts to communicate effectively and properly. This includes the way in which emergency calls have to be relayed through the communications systems in prison." Paramedics did re-enter the cell after a member of prison healthcare (a registered general nurse) attended. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Treatment was given and there was a return of spontaneous circulation.</span> Mr Dawes-Clarke was conveyed to Medway Maritime Hospital, having arrested again whilst being taken there. In the emergency department he became asystole and despite efforts at treating him, he died there. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + care + staff + staff">The jury found that, "the level of understanding and care from the prison staff was grossly insufficient." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Despite the severity of the incident which occurred in this case, there had been little (if any) dialogue between leaders of the various parties involved.</span> Formal complaint processes, safeguarding processes and risk reporting mechanisms had been used, but there was no discussion about how to learn from this specific case or how to avoid a reoccurrence. During prevention of future death evidence, responses were inconsistent as to how to avoid other difficulties during a major medical emergency in a prison setting. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: access + care">One suggestion made was that paramedics may not enter custodial settings in future but it was unclear how prison healthcare could replicate the skills had by the ambulance service (in particular, in the use of intraosseous access during initial resuscitation, or the skill sets of a critical care paramedic or an advance trauma team which may be delivered by a helicopter emergency medical service). (2) Despite the severity of the incident which occurred in this case, it appeared that there still remains confusion as to which public body would have primacy in an acute medical emergency in a custodial setting. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as the Secretaries of State for Justice, Health and Social Care have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following interested persons in the inquest touching upon the death of Azroy Dawes-Clarke. I have also sent it to the following who may find it useful or of interest: The Chair of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives; and The Chief Executive Officer of NHS England. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Justice; The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. 1 CORONER I am Ian Brownhill, Assistant Coroner for Kent and Medway. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 November 2021 an investigation commenced into the death of Azroy DAWES-CLARKE.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: factors">The jury returned a narrative conclusion which read: "From hearing all the evidence presented to us, we conclude that Azroy Dawes-Clarke died from a combination of factors beginning with the compression of the neck via self-inflicted ligaturing.</span> This was followed by a disproportionate use of force by prison officers during control and restraint which led to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">After restraint, there was insufficient action taken by prison staff and paramedics upon realising Mr Dawes-Clarke's cardiac and respiratory arrest.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">From the body-worn footage, it is evident that prison staff neglected to consider Mr Dawes-Clarke's head positioning and breathing throughout the restraint.</span> The poor practice of applying handcuffs while Mr Dawes-Clarke was in a kneeling position more than minimally increased the risk of positional asphyxia." The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury due to cardio-respiratory arrest in close temporal proximity to a period of third party restraint shortly after apparent seizure like activity following compression of the neck by a ligature 1b 1c 1d II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Azroy Dawes-Clarke died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 10 November 2021. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: mental health + communication + care + care + between + between">The jury who heard the case, recorded that, " prior to the 10th November and on the day of Mr Dawes-Clarke's passing, there was a lack of communication between all parties involved with regards to Mr Dawes-Clarke's physical and mental health." Mr Dawes-Clarke had ligatured in both the houseblock, and in the separation and care unit of HMP Elmley, prior to the date of his death.</span> A decision was made to move Mr Dawes-Clarke to the inpatient department of HMP Elmley. Mr Dawes-Clarke was placed in a safer cell with no ligature points. He [REDACTED] applied a ligature to his neck, self-strangulating. The jury recorded, " Mr Dawes-Clarke did not intend to end his own life when he used the ligature on the 10th November. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: listened + staff + staff + mechanism + mechanism">Rather, ligaturing was a known coping mechanism of Mr Dawes-Clarke, which he would use in order to be listened to." A member of healthcare staff saw him self-strangulating.</span> Officers entered the cell and removed the ligature. A, "code blue" was called, which automatically caused an ambulance to be called to the prison. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: time + staff + staff">Prison healthcare staff, including two general practitioners working within the prison at the time were able to attend the cell and stabilise Mr Dawes-Clarke.</span> Paramedics attended the inpatient department and made the decision to convey Mr Dawes-Clarke to hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The prison healthcare staff, including the general practitioners then left the area.</span> The general practitioners provided a handover to the paramedics and left the prison it being the end of their shift and nobody asking them to stay. Mr Dawes-Clarke had been wearing an anti-ligature gown. This left him exposed, a decision was made to clothe him. Whilst efforts were made to clothe Mr Dawes-Clarke, it was suggested that he had kicked one of the paramedics, who then left the cell. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">The jury went on to record: "For Mr Dawes-Clarke's conveyance to hospital, it was appropriate to attempt to clothe him.</span> However, it was inappropriate to persevere with clothing attempts. The decision making model should have been utilised, and attempts to clothe him should have stopped at the point of resistance. Following the initiation of restraint against Mr Dawes-Clarke, the continued restraint escalated unnecessarily. The prolonged restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke was inappropriate and disproportionate." During the restraint of Mr Dawes-Clarke, the paramedics were not in the cell. Prison healthcare were not in the cell either. The jury recorded: "The considerable delay in contacting healthcare to attend throughout the restraint, and furthermore the delay in raising the general alarm caused a significant hindrance. Prison officers were not able to receive vital medical advice for carrying out the restraint. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">This demonstrates that the lack of healthcare throughout the restraint was a failure and not in line with prison guidance.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">The ability of the paramedics to perform their duty of care to Mr Dawes-Clarke during the restraint was limited by their placement and lack of visibility from outside the cell.</span> Furthermore, it was inappropriate for the paramedics to approve the handcuffing of Mr Dawes-Clarke having had no training in mechanical restraint to give such advice." Mr Dawes-Clarke was handcuffed (something which the jury found to be inappropriate considering his positioning) and he went limp and became unresponsive. Mr Dawes-Clarke had a cardiac and respiratory arrest. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record, attendance">The jury went on to record: "There were significant shortcomings from both the paramedics and prison officers in attendance in their responses to Mr Dawes-Clarke going limp and unresponsive.</span> Specifically, the delay in establishing whether he was breathing and the inaction and further delay when starting CPR. Throughout the whole incident, there was a failure on all parts to communicate effectively and properly. This includes the way in which emergency calls have to be relayed through the communications systems in prison." Paramedics did re-enter the cell after a member of prison healthcare (a registered general nurse) attended. Treatment was given and there was a return of spontaneous circulation. Mr Dawes-Clarke was conveyed to Medway Maritime Hospital, having arrested again whilst being taken there. In the emergency department he became asystole and despite efforts at treating him, he died there. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + care + care + staff + staff">The jury found that, "the level of understanding and care from the prison staff was grossly insufficient." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: communication + between, staff + between, staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) As the jury noted, communication between attending prison staff, healthcare professionals and paramedics was confused.</span> There was confusion as to who had command and control of the medical emergency, which public body took primacy and the difference in roles and responsibilities. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

The carbon monoxide had been expelled from a lit liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater. The bathroom was of insufficient size for the flue-less liquified petroleum gas cabinet heater to be safely used without causing a build-up of carbon monoxide. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

A warning label was affixed inside the cabinet heater in the space occupied by the liquified petroleum gas bottle. There was an absence of a visible warning label on the outside of the heater. It was not obvious to all potential users of the heater that the heater could only be used safely in a room of sufficient dimension. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Minister of State for Health The Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Executive The Lift and Escalator Industry Association 1 CORONER I am Linda Lee, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 24 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Mary LANGWORTHY, 61.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, heard before a jury, from 7 July 2025 to 10 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Accident The cause of death was: 1a. Asphyxiation 1b. 1c. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff

Keywords: equipment + care + care + policy + care + staff + equipment">It was also used to move bulky equipment, although care home policy prohibited staff from travelling in the lift with equipment.</span> For reasons that remain unclear, Miss Langworthy entered the lift with stand aid. As the lift descended, the wheels of the stand aid caught on the edge of the lift platform, causing it to become wedged and pin Miss Langworthy against the wall of the lift shaft. Although she was able to call for help, Miss Langworthy could not reach the controls. The platform continued to descend, suspending her mid-air. By the time she was freed, she was unresponsive, and resuscitation was unsuccessful. An experienced HSE engineer examined the lift and confirmed there were no mechanical defects in either the lift or the stand aid. The engineer found that, once the downward toggle switch had been activated, the platform continued to move under latch control, placing the controls out of Miss Langworthy's reach, as she remained trapped above the platform. The platform could not be stopped via the control wall pressure switch while descending. The engineer noted that such risks were known within the industry, with a history of wheelchair users being injured in similar circumstances. She explained that "hold-to-run" controls - now a requirement under current standards (BS EN 81-41:2010)—would likely have prevented the incident, as the passenger would be expected to release the control in the event of danger. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">However, the lift pre-dated this requirement (BS 6440:1999), and such standards are not applied retrospectively. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: care + care + care + awareness">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Many platform lifts still in use in care settings and other premises do not have hold-to-run controls. (2) Evidence was received indicating that such controls can be retrofitted at relatively low cost. (3) There is limited awareness of both the risks posed by the absence of hold-to-run devices and the feasibility of fitting such devices to existing platform lifts. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organization have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Signature Linda Lee Assistant Coroner Coventry and Warwickshire

(3) There is limited awareness of both the risks posed by the absence of hold-to-run devices and the feasibility of fitting such devices to existing platform lifts. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organization have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 September 2025.</td>

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: CHIEF EXECUTIVE ABMU HEALTH BOARD 1 TALBOT GATEWAY BAGLAN ENERGY PARK BAGLAN PORT TALBOT SA12 7BR 1 CORONER I am Aled Gruffydd , Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of SWANSEA NEATH & PORT TALBOT 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 19 th of June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gareth Wynne Tatchell. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26 th June 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: team">Gareth was referred to the maxillo-facial team at Morriston Hospital on the 12 th of April 2023 by his dentist following the discovery of an ulcer in the lower left mandible.</span> The referral was classed as an urgent suspected cancer (USC) and Gareth was seen in outpatients clinic on the 28 th of April 2023. Cancer was suspected at that point, specifically a squamous cell carcinoma but it needed to be confirmed by a biopsy. That biopsy took place on 18 May and the result came back on 30 May as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Gareth was seen again on the 19 th of June and further tests consisting of a CT of the thorax, a CT angiogram of the legs and an MRI and ultrasound of the neck were undertaken on the 28 th . <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: treatment + care + care + care">Care was then transferred to the treating consultant maxillofacial surgeon who first saw Gareth on the 6 th of July, and then on the 27 July to discuss treatment, which would consist of surgery and radiotherapy.</span> Due to theatre capacity, the earliest date being 13 September. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: spread">By the week prior to surgery Gareth had developed a lump both inside and out, meaning that the lump was visible on the outside but it would also have spread to the blood vessels in the neck.</span> The surgery was able to remove the tumour macroscopically i.e all that was visible to the naked eye, but as it was encasing the carotid it would not be possible to remove it all. In February 2024 the treating consultant saw Gareth in hospital after he had gone in to have the AAA repaired. It was then that Gareth complained of a pain in the neck which prompted the CT scan showing an enlargement and a biopsy then confirmed that the cancer had returned. Gareth was discharged from hospital following the AAA repair but was readmitted to hospital on the 8 th of March 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: treatment + spread">The result of that delay was that it made the carcinoma more difficult to treat in that it would not have had the extracapsular spread or the encasement of the carotid that was witnessed at the end of August and which was not present around the end of June when treatment ought to have taken place.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: treatment + spread">Had the timescales had been complied with then treatment would have been administered before extracapsular spread had occurred.</span> Evidence was received from the treating consultant that this contributed towards Gareth's death. Evidence was heard that since this incident there had been an improvement in theatre capacity with additional theatre sessions having been allocated to oral and maxillofacial surgery, and an additional Consultant Maxillofacial Oncological Surgeon has been appointed to undertake both surgery and outpatient appointments. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Keywords: time">Part of the delays resolve around the time taken to undertake staging scans for the purpose of the diagnostic and staging phase. 3.</span> Two Associate Medical Directors have communicated that delays in undertaking staging scans are ongoing and are having an impact on survivability rates and prognoses by making treatable cancers irresectable. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND/OR your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Chief Executive, East Midlands Ambulance Service 2 Chief Constable for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Police 3 College of Policing 4 Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 5 Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Ms Alexandra Pountney, Assistant Coroner for the coroner's area of South Yorkshire (West) (sitting in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire coroner's area). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST An investigation into the death of Kaine Regan FLETCHER was opened on 28 September 2022, and the final inquest hearing is currently being heard by me, sitting with a jury.</span> The final inquest hearing started on 30 June 2025 and concluded on 25 July 2025. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kaine was a 26-year-old male with a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and a history of substance misuse. On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The officers requested assistance from the Street Triage Team, a team formed through collaboration between Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who duly attended to assess Kaine arriving at 17:04.</span> The Street Triage Team comprised of one police officer and one community psychiatric nurse, travelling together in a marked police car. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: between + between">Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall.</span> The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46. On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. EMAS advised the family member that the incident had been logged as a Category 3 response, and that there was an 8 hour wait for an ambulance. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">At 00:33 a member of Kaine's family called the police to report their concerns.</span> A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle. During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance. He arrived at 03:47. Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: This PFD should be read in conjunction with the PFD that I issued mid-inquest, dated 17 July 2025. 1. Lack of joint agency policy/cross-sector working on Acute Behavioural Disorder/Disturbance In September 2022, the Royal College of Psychiatrists issued a position statement on Acute Behavioural Disturbance and Excited Delirium. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: between + between">Lack of agreed joint agency policy between EMAS and the police on s.136 MHA 1983 detentions I issued a PFD on 17 July 2025, part way through the final inquest hearing, to raise my concern over the apparent confusion with both the police and EMAS as to the applicable joint agency policy dealing with s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance.</span> Since that PFD was issued, the evidence has developed and the position at the end of the inquest was as follows: - The police confirmed that the document titled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" has been ratified within their organisation and continues to remain the relevant joint-agency policy for s.136 detention and conveyance. This policy has been implemented for the police since its inception. - EMAS cannot confirm whether the above policy has been ratified in its current version within the organisation. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">They have confirmed that an employee at EMAS signed off on the 2021 version, but that this information was never disseminated within the organisation because the finalised version of the policy remained within that employee's email inbox.</span> The consequence appears to be that EMAS has never implemented this policy, rather they have been working to an internal policy for Mental Health Conveyance that contains different working standards. Acknowledging that there is no confusion for the police as to the relevant policy, and that they do consider that it has been implemented, I remain concerned. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: between + between">For a policy to be effective, all purported parties to that policy need to know it applies to them. - Internal disorganisation within EMAS has culminated in a situation where, even after a period of investigation between 17 July - 25 July, they are unable to tell the Court which, if any, joint agency policy applies to them.</span> They are unable to tell the Court whether they are still part of the relevant working group. EMAS have allowed a situation to perpetuate in which they appear, on the face of the policy documents, to be party to an agreement (which includes service level agreements for conveyance) when they simply do not know if this is correct. The upshot of this is that other agencies may be placing reliance on the conveyance terms within the policy when they are dealing with s.136 detention. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

I also heard evidence, that in the last 12 months an ambulance was called by the police in only 50% of s.136 detentions. Of that 50% in which an ambulance was called, an ambulance only attended on 50% of occasions (so 25% of the total detentions). Of the nine police officers that gave evidence to me in this inquest on s.136 matters, none of them knew about the police policy on calling an ambulance to convey a s.136 detainee. Two of the officers knew, anecdotally, that an ambulance was the preferred method of conveyance, but their evidence was that it was common for an ambulance to take well over 30 minutes or not turn up at all. I am concerned that: - There is a training issue within the police in relation to s.136 detentions and the correct mode of conveyance. Either officers do not know that they should call an ambulance, or they are ignoring their training/the instructions that they are given. This is born out in the statistics above. - There is a response issue on the part of EMAS. This may, in part, be explained by the policy/service level agreement confusion within EMAS. 4. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

I am concerned that training in the area of mental health generally is lacking, which is impacting upon the approach of the police officers dealing with mental health related incidents. 5. The availability of the Street Triage Team I heard evidence that Nottinghamshire is pioneering in its provision of a Street Triage Team, a service that has been available since 2014. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

I am concerned that there is a need to review the data to ensure that the demand for the service in 2025 is still reflected by the shift patterns. I am concerned, based on the evidence that I heard from EMAS in relation to an increase of ~60% in mental health related calls, that the demand for service may have changed since 2017. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The provision to protect a trespasser at night are the same as those during the day. The ability to locate a person close to or on the railway lines at night is made more difficult by the absence of suitable lights on the track or the train. In this case Mr English was not seen and run over by the train that has been asked to look for a person on the line . 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organization have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Friday 19th September 2025 I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Keywords: care + care + care">Milton Keynes Urgent Care Service 1 CORONER I am Tom OSBORNE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jordan Michael BABB aged 31.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion The deceased died of a pulmonary embolism which was not recognised or treated despite presenting with abnormal clinical observations suggestive of this condition. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The decision to discharge the deceased without further investigation or escalation of care contributed to his death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had been complaining of chest pain and had visited the Urgent Care Centre in Milton Keynes on Friday 13th September 2024.</span> He was assessed and put on a nebuliser for his asthma. He was discharged with a follow up GP appointment. He was not investigated for a possible pulmonary embolism. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the 16th September 2024 he collapsed and despite resuscitation died of a pulmonary embolism at [REDACTED]. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + care + patient">Failure to Escalate Abnormal Observations Despite the patient presenting with a significantly elevated heart rate, high respiratory rate, and reduced oxygen saturations — all indicative of physiological instability — there was no escalation to secondary care or referral to the emergency department.</span> There appears to have been no formal threshold or protocol in place to ensure that abnormal observations of this nature trigger an urgent clinical response. 2. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">Lack of Structured Risk Assessment for Pulmonary Embolism Although pulmonary embolism was a relevant clinical possibility, no structured risk assessment tool (such as the Wells score) was used or documented, and there was no attempt to apply an evidence-based diagnostic pathway as recommended by NICE guidance (NG158). 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Slips or Lapses
Keywords: care + care + care + misunderstanding">Unclear Use or Misunderstanding of Clinical Decision Tools Evidence suggested uncertainty about the appropriate use of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in primary care settings, with potential misapplication outside of the specific context recommended by NICE (i.e., in low-risk patients only and following validated pre-test probability assessment).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: care + care + care + training">There appears to be a lack of clarity or training regarding the scope and limitations of such tools in the primary care context. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: conditions + mechanism + mechanism">Risk of Repetition in Similar Settings The inquest heard no evidence that the walk-in centre has a specific protocol or decision- support mechanism in place for the recognition and escalation of potentially life-threatening conditions such as pulmonary embolism.</span> There is a risk that similar failings could occur in future, particularly where patients present with non-specific symptoms and abnormal vital signs. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19th September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Family of Mr Jordan Michael BABB I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service Executive Director Public Sector Prisons South 1 CORONER I am Patricia Harding, senior coroner for the coroner area of Kent and Medway 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 rd July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Pugh, 29 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 st July2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide; Mr. Pugh having suspended himself in his cell at HMP Swaleside [REDACTED]. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Michael Pugh was found in his cell on 29 th June 2024 having died. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">He was subject of an ACCT at the time of his death.</span> It was determined at the last ACCT review before his death that he should be subject to hourly observations.

Keywords: concerns + record">Pugh was discovered having died, but the ongoing record was completed retrospectively to show that they had been carried out 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: training">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The prison officers who gave evidence in relation to observations on 28 th and 29 th June 2024 were relatively new recruits, one having 3 months experience following POELT training and the other 1 month experience.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: training">Both officers gave evidence that following their POELT training their understanding of the ACCT process was incomplete; one stating "observations were explained but I didn't have a fair idea what to do or how to undergo the process", another stating "I didn't understand the importance of observing a prisoner at unpredictable times.</span> Even though I was told the observations should be hourly it was not explained to me how to stagger timing. I misunderstood what was required of me in recording the details when I recorded them as having happened at 13.00, 14.00, 15.00 and 16.00. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 th September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not yet been heard. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Diagnosis of severe silicosis lung disease. Awaiting lung transplant. Admitted on Friday 17th May 2024 for potential lung transplant to Harefield Hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

Keywords: too unwell, not suitable">Not suitable for transplant as too unwell.</span> Deteriorated and died in hospital on 22 May 2024. Cause of death 1a Respiratory Failure 1b Silicosis (Occupational lung disease) Wessam had been working with artificial stone products which contain a very high percentage of Crystalline silica content. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: dust">The dust created when these products are cut, sanded and carved creates respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and is too fine to see with normal lighting.</span> It is recognised to cause silicosis if inhaled which causes a hardening or scarring of the lung tissue with initially no symptoms. Once silicosis develops it is untreatable apart from offering lung transplantation. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: concerns + dust, exposure to">The health risks are almost entirely preventable if exposure to dust is adequately controlled. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: exposure to">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - This young man presented with an untreatable lung condition probably caused by exposure to RCS in his workplace.</span> This company, "Yes, Marble Ltd" is no longer trading. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring
Keywords: safety + monitoring">Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year surveillance programmes.</span> In this case exposure appears to have commenced in May 2016 and he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2021, a mere 5 years after initial exposure. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment
Keywords: conditions + dust, unsafe conditions">Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure.</span> Australia has already taken the decision in 2024 to ban these artificial stone products. There are a number of patients in the UK currently awaiting lung transplants due to RCS exposure from their workplaces. The last 2 decades have seen rapid growth in the use of artificial stone and this death demonstrates the emergence of a severe progressive accelerated form of silicosis. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Physical Environment

Keywords: access">He also acquired access and consumed illicitly brewed alcohol ‘Hooch'.</span> Although the levels of these substances on their own would not be fatal, when consumed altogether, they caused a high level of sedation and this combined with Sheldon's body posture resulted in respiratory depression. At no point had it been identified that Sheldon had in his possession or was under the influence of un-prescribed drugs and hooch. This resulted in no additional checks on Sheldon during the night until he was found at 5:10am. Sheldon did not intend to end his life as a consequence of his actions but deliberately consumed these substances. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Evidence was given at the Inquest that in the month of September 2022, 215.5 litres of illicitly brewed alcohol were seized at HMP Guys Marsh. Evidence was given that Hooch continues to be a common problem in prisons. Illicitly brewed alcohol in prison is a substance made from items which are readily and legitimately available to prisoners. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Secretary of State for Health 2 Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Henry CHARLES, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 28 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Kate YOUNG aged 49.</span> The inquest was concluded on 5 th June 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a Hanging. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest On 20th November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED]. Sadly, she had intentionally taken her own life by hanging herself with a ligature. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Agency staff form a significant percentage of frontline staff. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

This report is being sent to: Hampshire County Council | National Highways
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED] - Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire County Council 2. [REDACTED] - Chief Executive Officer, National Highways 1 CORONER I am Rosamund RHODES-KEMP, HM Area Coroner for the coroner area of Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 09 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Alexander SCOTT aged 25.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the evening of 5th July 2024 James Scott, aged 25, was driving Southbound on the A33 when he lost control of the vehicle which turned sideways crossing onto the opposite carriageway colliding with a Northbound vehicle. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He sustained fatal injuries and was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH This report concerns a fatal road traffic collision between a Vauxhall Corsa and a Ford Ranger towing a SBS trailer upon which was a trailer, which occurred around 21:44 on Friday 5th July 2024 on the A33 near Kings Worthy, Hampshire.</span> Mr Scott was travelling South in his Vauxhall Corsa where the vehicle has passed through an area of standing water. Consequently, the Corsa has entered a state of clockwise yaw, passing through the central reserve and into the path of the oncoming Ford Ranger which was travelling North. The Vauxhall and Ford have collided in ‘T-Bone' formation, with Mr Scott sustaining fatal injuries and being sadly declared deceased at the scene. On examination it was observed that two of the drains to the nearside of the southbound lane were compacted with vegetation, resulting in little or no surface drainage. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues
Keywords: maintenance">This is despite annual scheduled maintenance for year 2023/2024 taking place on 19th May 2023 and 15th November 2023.</span> This included clearing gullies and catch pits either side of the A33. A Temporary "Flood" warning sign was located within the nearside grass verge, around 8 meters north of the commencement of the flooding. The ‘Temporary' warning sign had been present for about 5 years prior to the collision. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_External - Economic factor + I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Escalation/referral factor (including fresh eyes reviews)
Keywords: maintenance + factor + factor + factor">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) The area is a known flood risk (2) Whilst the precise cause of the flooding is unknown, a more regular maintenance schedule may have prevented the buildup of vegetation within the gullies and therefore assisted in the drainage of the heavy rainfall experienced that day thus reducing the amount of surface water present on the road (3) The fact that only a Temporary Sign was in place in an area known for years to be a flood risk (4) The surface water was a contributory factor in this death 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 18, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I have also sent it to [REDACTED] who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Kent Central Ambulance Service 1 CORONER I am Ms.</span> Catherine Wood, Assistant Coroner for North East Kent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 4 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Emily Rose STOKES. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The conclusion of the inquest was Drug related death 1a MDMA Toxicity 1b 1c 1d II 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Emily Stokes was 17 years old and a looked after child, having been in foster care since 2012.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Since 17 May 2024 she had been living in a semi independent placement in Chingford following the breakdown in her foster care placement in Kent.</span> She had made plans to meet friends at the Worried about Henry music festival at Dreamlands in Margate, Kent on 29 June 2024. Her friends reported that she had taken MDMA possibly shortly before she entered the festival but she was also seen taking a tablet not long after she arrived at the festival. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">There had been bag and pat down searches undertaken by security staff for all those entering the festival but no drugs were found in any search she underwent as she would not have been allowed entry.</span> She started behaving erratically and assistance was sought and she was taken to the on site medical tent arriving at approximately 15.23 and was distressed and agitated as well as tachycardic and hyperpyrexial. A set of observations recorded at 15.34 showed a respiratory rate of 28, saturations of 94%on air, a blood pressure of 143/119 and a heart rate of 186 with a temperature of 40.6 degrees and a NEWS score of 9. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Biases and stereotyping + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: providers + providers">At 15.43 ambulance crew working for providers at the event were radioed and asked to return to the site to take Emily to hospital.</span> They arrived back at the medical tent shortly after 4pm and are seen leaving the medical tent with the private ambulance crew at 16.16 and they left the site at 16.19. During this time Emily remained hyperpyrexial, tachycardic, distressed and confused and no attempts at reducing her temperature were undertaken. No pre alert call was made to the hospital and the journey was made without lights and sirens. The journey time was approximately 5 or 6 minutes so she arrived at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital at approximately 16.25/6. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: communication + between, staff + between, staff">Emily was then assisted back up the stretcher by a paramedic and there was then a delay in her being triaged due to communication issues between the private ambulance staff and the triage nurse.</span> The paramedic who had assisted in moving Emily recognised the severity of Emily's presentation and assisted with getting her moved to the resuscitation area in the emergency department. She was documented as having been seen by a doctor at 16.45 although the timings were written retrospectively and accounts indicated that as she was wheeled into the resuscitation bay the doctor was present. It was recognised that she was critically unwell and cooling measures were instituted and intravenous benzodiazepines given as she was displaying the ill effects of MDMA toxicity and suffering from serotonin syndrome. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: concerns + care + care + care">Intensive care clinicians were called and the team were preparing to intubate her when she suffered a cardiac arrest and despite efforts at resuscitation which lasted more than an hour she was pronounced dead shortly after 6pm. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Biases and stereotyping + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: providers + care, providers + care + care + staff + staff + training">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) Private ambulance providers were used and the training of the staff involved was minimal, the evidence heard indicated that they had a qualification called First Response Emergency Care level 4 which was a five day course and had little experience or training in relation to management of patients having taken drugs.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: staff + staff + training">Given that the teams on site were present and ambulances available at a music event where the risk of drug taking was deemed to be high more training should have been provided to assist the staff in how to safely manage those under the influence of illicit substances. (2) There was a lack of clarity regarding who had responsibility for making a pre alert call to the hospital and given this young girl was significantly unwell this should have been done.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: equipment + staff + staff + training + equipment">This in part may have been due to the lack of recognition of the seriousness of her symptoms and therefore potentially linked with training of staff. (3)The ambulance did not have the same equipment which an NHS Ambulance would have on board and was in essence very little more than a means of transport from the venue to the hospital and may have given a false sense of reassurance. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Kent Central Ambulance Service have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 July 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

He had vomited following the ingestion and it is likely that he aspirated. On admission, he was discovered to be suffering from suspected pneumonitis which was considered likely to have arisen from aspiration of detergent and stomach acid when vomiting after the accidental ingestion. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the course of evidence it was noted that the plastic bottle like packaging in which the white liquid washing detergent was contained was confused by the deceased as a milk carton. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: dementia">He suffered from dementia and appeared to have poured the liquid into a cup of tea he had made, subsequently placing the detergent container in the fridge. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Yorkshire Contributory_Communication and Culture- Safety Culture + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: safety + no safety + dementia">The container had a screw top with no safety features meaning that it would be easily accessible by a person with reduced capacity or dementia, or even a child enabling the contents able to be consumed with apparent ease. 3.</span> Whilst the liquid was deemed to have low toxicity, on the evidence it led to vomiting and aspiration causing damage to the lungs and subsequent breathing difficulties. In this case this was causative of death. 4. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: risk">The level of printed warnings on the labelling was not explored during the hearing, but this may not specify that the item could be a risk to vulnerable adults as well as the need to keep out of the reach of children. 6.</span> The public knowledge of these risks is not likely to be at a level where households in which vulnerable adults reside are aware of the need to safeguard detergents and make them less accessible. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

Keywords: time">However, having heard evidence from Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, I note that the main reason for the delay in dispatching emergency ambulances remains the length of time it is taking for ambulances to be released from the emergency department of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board hospitals, predominantly the Grange University Hospital.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive/Managing Director Home Group Limited One Strawberry Lane Newcastle-upon-Tyne Tyne & Wear NE1 4BX 1 CORONER I am Ian Singleton, Area Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 14 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher John O'Donnell and I opened an Inquest into his death on 30 September 2024.</span> On 18 July 2025 I concluded Christopher's Inquest. I found the medical cause of death was as follows: 1a. Asphyxia due to Airway Obstruction by Vomit 1b. Drug Toxicity By way of a conclusion, I recorded a short form conclusion of drug related and as to when where and how (by what means Christopher came by his death) I provided the following: Christopher John O'Donnell (Chris) lived in supported living accommodation at Canal House, [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medication + mental health + mental health + medical history">Chris had a past medical history which included drug and alcohol abuse, together with mental health issues, for which he had been prescribed medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">In November 2023, Chris admitted that he had not taken his medication for some months, leading to a noticeable return of his paranoia and persecution complex, resulting in Chris believing wrongly, that it was not safe for him to remain at Canal House., but he had no alternative accommodation to go to.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: medication + access">On the 12 December 2023, Chris was found deceased in a communal lounge at Canal House, having consumed a substantial, but not fatal amount of his methadone medication, that he had been allowed access to, notwithstanding the recognised risks, which had led to him vomiting and being asphyxiated by his airway being obstructed by vomit. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Having considered the evidence, I found the following facts in relation to the circumstances of Chris' death.</span> Chris' death was drug related in that the post-mortem confirmed that he had taken a substantial, but not necessarily fatal amount of his prescribed Methadone that led to his central nervous systems including breathing and heart rate being slowed down. Common side effects are nausea and vomiting with the vomit being aspirated causing obstruction of Chris' airway leading to asphyxia and death. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: medication + factors">I found that the following factors more than minimally contributed to his decision to take that medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: medication + mental health + mental health">Firstly, that Christopher had suffered for a number of years with drug and alcohol abuse and with his mental health, for which he had been prescribed medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Christopher had stated that he had stopped taking the medication leading to a return of paranoia and a persecution complex leading to Chris believing it was not safe for him to live at Canal House [REDACTED] but Chris did not have any alternative accommodation to go to on 12 December 2023.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Secondly, that Chis had a stockpile of Methadone in his room which he had access to as from 11 December 2023 and consumed one half of, leading to the sequence of events that caused his death, despite the risk of that stockpile, being recognised beforehand.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: medication + mental health + local + team + mental health">During the course of the Inquest, I heard evidence from [REDACTED] a Mental Health Support Worker at Canal House that she had had a discussion with [REDACTED] Christopher's Recovery Co-Ordinator with the local Substance Misuse Team, that Chris had a stockpile of Methadone medication in his room and that she was concerned at the risk that it posed.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: medication + pharmacy">In evidence [REDACTED] said that she had spoken to Christopher about agreeing to giving up the medication and returning it to a pharmacy but as he had not consented, that had not happened.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: medication + concerns">She also believed that she had raised it with her manager, but the view was, that as Christopher had not consented to the medication being confiscated there was nothing they could do. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The issue that I had was that there appeared to be no basis for or consideration of the supported living accommodation provider, taking action to provide safeguarding for Christopher by removing the excess medication so that it was not within his control.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: medication + mental health + informed + staff + staff + mental health">I was informed by [REDACTED] that the supported living accommodation provider did not allow staff to hold any medication even if it was done with the intention of providing safeguarding to someone, who by all accounts, was undergoing a mental health crisis.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: consent">I would hope that the organisation will review its policies as to what action (if any) it can take when it is made aware of a risk to a resident, rather than to only take action with the resident's consent. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Person, Family of Mr O'Donnell I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person whom she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated 21 July 2025 Signature: Ian Singleton HM Area Coroner for Wiltshire & Swindon

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Alexandra Homes Ltd 1 CORONER I am M.</span> E. Voisin HM Senior Coroner for Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 7 th January 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Melissa Louise Mathieson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 th July 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The medical cause of death was: 1a) Severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury associated with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with features highly suggestive of neck compression The conclusion of the inquest was a short form with a narrative which read as follows: "Melissa died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Facility and Equipment Issues

" 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Melissa was autistic, suffered with ADHD and had a diagnosis of Asperger's, she was 18yrs old and was vulnerable. She became a resident of Alexandra Homes in August 2014 along with another resident, called [REDACTED], who went on to murder her on 12 th October 2014. [REDACTED] had undergone an assessment with a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, [REDACTED], who formed the opinion that he presented with a significantly high risk of future violence towards others, his violence also includes sexually harmful behaviour towards others including strangulation, the frequency and imminence of violence is also high, she said, that he should be supervised at all times. [REDACTED] had said that he wanted to kill somebody and have sex with their dead body. [REDACTED] was moving from a school where he had been supervised 24 hours a day on a 2:1 basis during the day and 1.5:1 at night. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: care + care + care + staff">When at Alexandra Homes his care plan stated 1:1 but was not 24hrs a day and was not 1:1 care at all, in that at night there were 16 residents to 1 support staff and during the day he was allocated a support worker to do activities, but he could wonder around the home on his own unsupervised.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: concerns + staff">Support workers, staff and Melissa raised concerns about [REDACTED]'s behaviour generally and specifically that Melissa was frightened of him.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: staff">On 12 th October at about 11.40pm, [REDACTED] and Melissa had already gone to their bedrooms, [REDACTED] was unsupervised, when staff heard a loud bang.</span> One of them said ..." I ran up the stairs and opened the fire door, Melissa was on her back, her legs were slightly skew whiff. Her head was slightly to one side facing the stairs, I could see one eye which was open and there was a cut above it, I could see marks around her neck which were very red. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: concerns + local">She was fully clothed and she appeared dead..." Melissa was taken to the local hospital but died a few days later from her injuries. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: supervision + review">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) the offer of placement and the level of supervision i.e. 1:1 was misleading, there was no clarification for example, 24hrs cover, 8hrs cover during the day only, or when carrying out activities or when outside the home only. (2) there was no formal induction period set for residents with formal weekly reviews (3) there was no formal review of the support plan and risk assessment especially during the induction period. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Alexandra Homes Ltd have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 th September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the chief coroner and to the following interested persons [REDACTED] States of Guernsey Higford School I am also under a duty to send the chief coroner a copy of your response. The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the chief coroner. 9 Signature M.</span> E. Voisin HM Senior Coroner for Avon Dated 21 st July 2025

REGULATION 28: REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Leeds City Council Highways. 1 CORONER I am John Hobson, Assistant Coroner for the Coroner Area of West Yorkshire (East). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dorothy Elizabeth Wagstaff who died on 11 January 2025.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 26 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: comorbidities">The medical cause of death was 1a) Multiple Traumatic Injuries 2) Multiple Medical Comorbidities.</span> In summary, Mrs Wagstaff died after the car she was driving collided with a post, plastic barriers, railings and a lamp post on the A660 Leeds Road at Otley. It was found to be more likely than not that the car moved towards the post, plastic barriers and railings after Mrs Wagstaff suffered a medical episode. The plastic barriers were temporary and provided little resistance to prevent the car leaving the road which then collided with railings and with the lamp post. The car came to a rest and paramedics attended but Mrs Wagstaff's death was confirmed at the scene. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The relevant facts pertaining to Mrs Wagstaff's death were recorded on the Record of Inquest at Box 3 which reads as follows: ‘On 11 January 2025 Dorothy Elizabeth Wagstaff was driving towards Bramhope on the A660 Leeds Road at Otley when her car steadily moved to the left of, then off, the inside lane before colliding with a concrete post to the road barrier. The car then collided with temporary plastic barriers which provided little or no resistance before hitting a further section of the road barrier comprised of posts and poles. The car then proceeded to hit a lamp post before coming to a stop in the road. Elizabeth sustained multiple traumatic injuries. Paramedics attended but her death was confirmed at the scene at 1057 hours. It is more likely than not that Elizabeth suffered a medical episode that led to her car initially colliding with the road barrier post and the gap in the road barrier enabled the car to then proceed to collide with road barrier posts and poles and the lamp post before coming to rest'. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">A conclusion of Road Traffic Collision was recorded. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. (1) The trajectory of Mrs Wagstaff's car after the initial collision with the concrete post involved passing through temporary plastic barriers which, on the evidence heard, offered no resistance such that the car then proceeded to leave the road and collide with a lamp post before coming to rest back on the road. (2) Upon examining photographs of the scene, the road barrier/railings and sections of the road, it was noted that plastic barriers similar to those referred to in the Record of Inquest above were present in another section of the A660 Leeds Road. (3) Within the evidence adduced at the inquest, it was noted that Leeds City Council Highways Department have indicated that a schedule of works will be created with a view to replacing the old concrete and metal pole barriers with metal pedestrian railings in this area of the A660. (4) The concern that I raise is that photographs considered at the inquest indicated the on-going presence of plastic barriers in a gap in the existing barrier/railings elsewhere along the stretch of road. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Geographical factor (e.g. Location of patient) + I-SIRch_External - Societal factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Escalation/referral factor (including fresh eyes reviews) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Incentive factor (e.g., performance evaluation)
Keywords: factor + factor + factor + factor">Plastic barriers were a factor in the circumstances of the accident in which Mrs Langstaff sadly died.</span> If that remains the case, I am of the view that action should be taken to prevent a risk of future deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 October 2025. I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Mrs Wagstaff's family. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Patryk's next of kin. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Chief Executive, East Midlands Ambulance Service 2. Chief Constable for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Police 1 CORONER I am Ms Alexandra Pountney, Assistant Coroner for the coroner's area of South Yorkshire (West) (sitting in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire coroner's area). 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST An investigation into the death of Kaine Regan FLETCHER was opened on 28 September 2022, and the final inquest hearing is currently being heard by me, sitting with a jury. The final inquest hearing started on 30 June 2025 and is due to conclude on 25 July 2025. The evidence is currently ongoing. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kaine was a 26-year-old male with a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and a history of substance misuse. On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The officers requested assistance from the Street Triage Team, a team formed through collaboration between Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who duly attended to assess Kaine arriving at 17:04.</span> The Street Triage Team comprised of one police officer and one community psychiatric nurse, travelling together in a marked police car. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: between + between">Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall.</span> The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46. On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. EMAS advised the family member that the incident had been logged as a Category 3 response, and that there was an 8 hour wait for an ambulance. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: resource">A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'.</span> Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: mental health + assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle.</span> During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance. He arrived at 03:47. Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Confusion over applicable local policy and working standards for dealing with s.136 detention I am concerned that there is a lack of understanding by the police and EMAS on local policy and working standards for dealing with s.136 detention. At the outset of this investigation, a direction was given for disclosure of " Local memoranda or policies concerning how EMAS and Notts police jointly manage health incidents ". <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: mental health + agency + review">In response to that direction, a number of policies were disclosed, including a document entitled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" .</span> Various versions of this policy were disclosed to the coroner, including a 2018, 2021 and 2024 version. During the course of the inquest so far, I heard evidence from both the police and the ambulance service in relation to the local policy for managing s.136 incidents. The police and the ambulance service do not share an understanding of which policy they are expected to adhere to and whether there is a joint local policy. The police consider that the document above (as amended) is the applicable framework, whilst EMAS are currently unable to tell me if this policy has agreed to by them, notwithstanding that they appear as one of the agencies that formed part of the working group for each version of the MOU. The witness who gave policy evidence on behalf of EMAS told me that they only work to their own internal local standard, which is different to that in the MOU. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout

This report is being sent to: National Highways Agency
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: National Highways Agency 1 CORONER I am Jacques Howell, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Hertfordshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 5 May 2024 inquests were opened into the deaths of Darren Christopher Reilly, aged 55, and, Tyler Cox, aged 18.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquests on 9 July 2025 in respect of Mr Reilly, and 11 July 2025 in respect of Miss Cox.</span> The inquests found that Mr Reilly died as a result of multiple traumatic injures, and Miss Cox died as a result of a traumatic head injury. The conclusion of both inquests was that both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox died in a Road Traffic Collision. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 1 April 2024, Mr Reilly was driving a Range Rover in company with this partner and her three children, one of whom was Miss Cox. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: safety + barrier">They were driving along the M1 southbound, when approximately 1 mile before the exit slip road for junction 5 for Watford, Mr Reilly lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle leaving the carriageway to the nearside, through a gap in the safety barrier that runs along the nearside of the M1 and colliding with trees.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">As a result of the collision both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox sustained fatal traumatic injuries, and their deaths were confirmed at the scene. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - I heard evidence that along this section of the M1 southbound there are safety barriers to the nearside of the carriageway.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: safety + risk + barrier">It was explained to me that if a vehicle loses control, the safety barrier is designed to prevent a vehicle from leaving the carriageway - the idea being that a vehicle that has lost control will continue along the safety barrier before coming to a more controlled stop, thereby minimising the risk of serious injury of death to passengers.</span> It was further explained to me that this is particularly important when a high-speed carriageway (such as a motorway) is lined with established trees, as is the case here. This is because any vehicle that has lost control and leaves the carriageway is likely to do so at high speed and collide with these established trees. This would likely lead to a very sharp and sudden deceleration, and may cause the vehicle to overturn, which significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury and death to passengers. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: safety">In this case, I was shown images of the collision scene which depict the presence of safety barriers shortly before and shortly after the collision site.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: safety + access + gaps + barrier">Whilst I heard evidence that, in general, gaps are sometimes inserted into the safety barrier for the purposes of access or due to the presence of other safety measures (e.g. a grassed bank), the witnesses from the Roads Policing Unit could not offer any explanation for why there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: safety + risk + barrier">Consequently, I am concerned that there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location, which for the reasons outlined above gives rise to a risk that future deaths may occur. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. The family of Mr Reilly 2. The family of Miss Cox I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Leonard Moaven
Coroners name: Mary Hassell
Coroners Area: Inner North London
Category: Suicide (from 2015) | Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: London Fire Brigade
Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Commissioner London Fire Brigade 169 Union Street London SE1 0LL 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 August 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Leonard Moaven, aged 61 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 January 2024. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide. Dr Moaven jumped from the roof of his block of flats at 5.33pm on 26 July 2023. He had got onto the roof by using a ladder to reach his attic and, when he got there, punching a hole through the roof tiles. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Before he jumped off the roof, Dr Moaven called the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), who in turn called the London Fire Brigade (LFB). When police officers tried to negotiate with him, Dr Moaven appeared receptive to the idea of coming down off the roof safely. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Police officers were reluctant to suggest that he return the way he had come, as by now it was raining and they were concerned that he would slip, and so he waited on the roof for firefighters to escort him. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. Dr Moaven rang police at 4.33pm, exactly one hour before he actually jumped off the roof. Police attended immediately and sought firefighter assistance immediately. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Keywords: attendance">Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance.</span> This had to travel from further afield and Dr Moaven became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 5.33pm when he jumped. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.</span> I did not take evidence from any firefighters at inquest, and so I appreciate that there may be elements of which I am unaware. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 March 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. 1. [REDACTED], wife of Leonard Moaven 2. [REDACTED], sister of Leonard Moaven 3. HHJ Thomas Teague QC, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it.

She fell whilst unobserved and when the bed rails were up when they should not have been. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: care + care + care">The evidence given to the inquest was that this delayed discharge and the ongoing risk it presents was not an isolated incident at TGH -as an example the evidence given was that there were regularly 30 plus patients with a delayed discharge over 3 weeks due to a lack of social care beds .The evidence indicated that this challenge was not unique to Tameside.</span> The evidence indicated that managing a falls risk and the consequential risk to life is better managed outside an acute setting once the clinical need for a hospital stay has passed. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres)
Keywords: availability">Delayed discharges such as Doreen Swann's reduces the availability of beds for other patients and creates a knock-on impact across the hospital particularly in relation to the Emergency Department. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 th September 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Deceased name: Alfie Lydon

This report is being sent to: NHS England | Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Midwifery Officer, NHS England via [REDACTED]; [REDACTED], President, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health via [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS An investigation into the death of Alfie Lydon (date of birth 28/2/24) was opened on 26/3/24, following his death on 12/3/24.</span> An inquest was opened on 18/4/24 and concluded on 27/6/25. The conclusion reached was that Alfie died from natural causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Alfie was admitted to hospital on 6/3/24 after being found profoundly unwell at home. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">He was subsequently transferred to another hospital for intensive care support but sadly died on 12/3/24 from a then unknown cause.</span> A post mortem examination demonstrated that he died from the consequences of a viral infection. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: concerns + team">Prior to his admission to hospital, concerns had been raised by Alfie's parents to the community midwife team regarding the adequacy of his feeding and increasing lethargy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: local + team">On two occasions midwives discussed Alfie with the neonatal team at the local hospital but admission was not felt to be necessary.</span> These discussions were not documented by the hospital doctors who took the calls and, on one occasion, not documented by the midwife who made the call. As such, it was difficult to identify who provided advice to the midwives and the rationale for the decision-making process. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Ultimately, given the overwhelming nature of the infection Alfie suffered from, I concluded that it was not likely earlier admission would have prevented his death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Alfie's death were as follows: 1. I heard evidence that the vast majority of hospital Trusts do not have processes in place to document external calls from midwives to hospital teams. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: concerns + care + care + care">Concerns were raised that this can result in a lack of continuity and escalation of care, particularly with regards to parental concerns.</span> The hospital Trust involved has taken steps to document such calls now but this is undertaken on paper, which is subsequently uploaded to the hospital records. They plan to implement an electronic solution but not for some time. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: between + documentation">There is a concern that a lack of contemporaneous, accurate and immediately available documentation of discussions between community and hospital teams could result in deaths in future similar circumstances.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: national, local">Given that this is not simply a local issue, this concern warrants raising at a national level. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressees have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, the Lydon family, the hospital Trusts, the Department of Health and Social Care and the CQC.</span> I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 15 July 2025 Assistant Coroner R Brittain

Keywords: medication + concerns + care + care + care">Contributing to the cause of his death was lack of adjustments for his Autism and Learning Disabilities resulting in incorrect decision making as to his care and medication. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The rider of Neglect attaches to the actions of the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (‘the Trust'). It relates to the lack of adjustments, that were identified as being required to treat Myles safely in the context of his Learning Disabilities (‘LD') and Autism notably during his admission 20-25 October 2022. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues
Keywords: training + issues">It is true that evidence from Trust witnesses has been sufficient to demonstrate that the Trust is aware of the issues arising in this case at least in terms of training and professional input.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Disability (e.g., hearing problems) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: care + care + care + disability + training">It has an ongoing programme of training in relation to Learning Disabilities and Autism in clinical care and they have people in post enhancing Learning Disability provision.</span> The crux of the remaining concern is in relation to auditing the impact of all of this in terms of auditing the outcome of this work. To be fair, Trust evidence was that there is now auditing of mental capacity assessments and there is dedicated nursing leadership walkaround of all wards auditing LD and autism policies being applied. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

One witness's own ‘spot-on' entries in the EPR on 21 October were just were not acted upon by colleagues and had zero effect when she went on leave thereafter. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 .</span> Dalton Surgery 2 . CQC North 3 . NHS England (Reg 28 Reports) 1 CORONER I am Crispin OLIVER, HM Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of West Yorkshire Western Coroner Area 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 03 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Myles Edward SCRIVEN aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Myles Edward Scriven died a natural death to which neglect contributed. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Myles Edward Scriven died at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary on 16 April 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: medication + concerns + care + care">Contributing to the cause of his death was lack of adjustments for his Autism and Learning Disabilities resulting in incorrect decision making as to his care and medication. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

Keywords: concerns">The following are concerns that I have arising from the evidence in he Inquest. 1.</span> Ignorance of what was required for Myles in the circumstances of his Learning Disability and Autism - the GPs clearly only had a superficial grasp of the regulatory requirements and realities to do with Learning Disabilities. They are clearly well intentioned and caring but their appreciation and approach seems to have been based entirely on professional experience and good intentions rather than real knowledge of what was required and how to implement it. Notably: •They repeatedly used the words learning difficulties and learning disabilities interchangeably and apparently randomly - I am not told that Myles had a personal preference about which to use that they deferred to. Essentially, they seem to have been ignorant as to the distinction. •They made only the most modest adjustments for Myles's Learning Disabilities and Autism. •They clearly had very little grasp of what the Learning Disabilities Register was and how it worked. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">Neither of the GPs who gave evidence were able to provide a solid, reliable, version of how it operated in their practice, when or/if Myles had been entered on to it, whether it was distinct from the psychiatric review - one seemed to conflate the two and the other said that it was something managed by a Nurse in the practice.</span> It is quite evident that correspondence was coming in from Learning Disabilities Psychiatry but nothing at all from Social Services. This is not something that seems to have triggered any particular reaction at the GP level. They seemed to operate on the basis that the Learning Disabilities ‘box had been ticked' and that nothing further was needed. In fact, Myles seems to have been on the Register from 2020 but by the 20 October 2022 when he had been at hospital in relation to his PE he had no Learning Disability Social Worker and concomitantly no VIP passport on admission to hospital . The GPs clearly had no idea of how important all this was. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Senior Partner Mountfield Surgery 55 Mountfield Road Finchley London N3 3NR 2. Chief Executive Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust Ground Floor 15 Marylebone Road London NW1 5JD 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Poplar Coroner's Court Bow Coroner's Court 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 5 February 2025, one of my assistant coroners, Ian Potter, commenced an investigation into the death of Noreen McGlynn aged 89 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a determination of death by natural causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Noreen McGlynn developed a throat infection and a urinary tract infection at home and was prescribed amoxicillin by her general practitioner. She suffered an anaphylactic reaction to this and was admitted to hospital. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: conditions">The reaction was reversed, but she died three days later from her underlying conditions.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">I recorded her medical cause of death as: 1a aspiration pneumonia 1b cerebrovascular disease and frailty of old age 2 anaphylaxis to penicillin. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that, even before her anaphylaxis Ms McGlynn was waiting for an ambulance to take her to hospital. This was on the advice of two GPs and with the agreement of her daughter. However, Noreen McGlynn's family did not want her to go to hospital. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: elderly">They believed that she had a better chance of remaining well out of hospital. (The challenges that hospital admission present to the elderly are very well recognised.) And if she were now dying, family knew that Ms McGlynn would want to die at home.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: situation">Her living situation was very supportive.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">She was a widow but she had an excellent full time carer and a loving, extremely engaged family, with her daughter living near by.</span> The reason that family now favoured hospital admission was because Ms McGlynn had become so dehydrated. They recognised that this was life threatening and likely to make her feel unwell. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Emergency preparedness + Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: rapid response + rapid response + team">If the rapid response team from the Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust who visited, or the GPs from Mountfield Surgery, had been able to offer rehydration at home, this would have been a far preferable course of action for Noreen McGlynn and for her loved ones.</span> Could such rehydration at home have been offered? Could it be offered to others in the future? 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: equipment + decisions + care + information + care + time + care + assessment + equipment">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) Despite recommendations for falls prevention equipment being made by the Community Falls Service in August 2023, no falls prevention equipment was put in place by the time of the Deceased's fall in October 2024 (2) Despite the social worker expressing concern about the lack of falls prevention equipment on 27 September 2024, no falls equipment was put in place prior to the Deceased's fall on 4 October 2024. (3) Information about the Community Falls Service recommendations was not passed on to the family, or to social services. (4) On 5 August 2024 (following a fall, but before the more significant fall on 4 October 2024), the Deceased's family were told by the Deputy Manager of Howlish Hall that the owner of Howlish Hall "probably wouldn't want to pay for a sensor mat". (5) I received evidence that, subsequent to the Deceased's death, there had been a reluctance on the part of [REDACTED] (who was believed to be the owner of Howlish Hall Care Home) to provide adequate resources for falls prevention equipment. (6) Despite it being recognised that the Deceased lacked mental capacity to make decisions about where she lived and was unable to keep herself safe, it appears that the home did not make any application for a DoLS assessment for the Deceased.</span> Indeed I received evidence that when a new home manager was appointed at Howlish Hall in January 2025 none of the residents were subject to a DoLS, despite a large number of the residents lacking mental capacity. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: See narrative conclusion 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Narrative Conclusion: Mr Paul Ransom sadly died on 24th May 2023 on the A272 between Meon Hut and Petersfield, approaching the village of Langrish, Hampshire. A 40mph speed limit applied. He lost control of his motorcycle whilst doing up to around 45mph and crossed into the oncoming carriageway, colliding with a lorry and sustaining the multiple injuries that caused his death. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: conditions">Conditions were excellent: full daylight, sunny and dry.</span> Surfacing work had been completed less than six hours before the collision. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The surface was very slippery and this caused or at least substantially contributed to the collision. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The resurfacing that had been carried out was an asphalt preservation treatment known as a "thin surface treatment" wherein a bituminous solution is cold sprayed onto the surface, overlaid with a silicate grit.</span> This is a commonly used method. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: treatment + conditions">I heard evidence that in the initial period after laying thin surface treatment has a particular property ("early life effects")in dry conditions the level of friction available can be akin to that of a wet road.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">There is no guidance that signage be provided.</span> There is also the potential for unpredictable vehicle behaviour, particularly at lower speeds or when road surface temperatures are high, by reason of a change in the level of fiction available to a vehicle during a steering manoeuvre or braking. This may have a greater effect on motorcycles. The newly applied surface looks like an ordinary tarmac road albeit pristine. There has been research into accident rates following application of thin surface treatments. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: concerns + informed">The research had the effect of allaying concerns but I was informed that the research may not have been able to look specifically at motorcycle accidents, and further informed that the issue of signage has been the subject of discussion in at least some highways authorities.</span> Thin surface treatments are to be distinguished from surface dressing wherein aggregates are applied, following which loose chipping warning signs are usually erected and a reduced speed limit applied for the days following application. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: treatment + conditions">Following thin surface treatment the drivers of vehicles, including motorcycles are likely to assume that in dry conditions the road surface is going to have the same properties as any established dry asphalt road surface.</span> I am concerned that where the road is, for example, downhill and/or twisting and/or with limited sight lines then it may be a particular problem if speeds are not adapted for the early life properties of thin surface treatments: particularly in the case of motorcycles. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: safety + treatment + review">I recommend review of actions to be taken for the safety of road users, particularly motorcycles, following application of thin surface treatments, during the early life phase following thin surface treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 th September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] Hampshire County Council (Hampshire Highways) I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) Liliwen's mother was given unlimited Entonox, as well as routine doses of pethidine and codeine. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: supervision + access + care + care + time + care">The result was that she effectively became comatose for a period of time, during which she delivered Liliwen; (2) Cardiff & Vale Health Board have taken significant steps to significantly restrict the use of analgesia during induction and labour, including reductions of prescribed doses, allowing only limited access to analgesia on the wards and increased levels of supervision of mothers under analgesia; (3) They have seen an escalation in the numbers of women being transferred from the induction ward to the delivery suite as a consequence of reduced analgesia, which would otherwise have masked the transition to active labour; and (4) The current NICE guidelines on Induction of Labour and Intrapartum Care do not deal explicitly with analgesia levels and supervision. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3rd September 2025.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period.

Deceased name: Gemma Poterajko
Coroners name: Elizabeth Didcock
Coroners Area: Nottinghamshire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Dr Elizabeth Didcock, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of Nottinghamshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23.8.24, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Gemma Louise Poterajko The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 27 th June 2025 The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows: Gemma died from a rare, unexpected, but recognised complication of a pacemaker lead extraction. She died from multi organ failure caused by catastrophic haemorrhage from two venous tears in the left innominate vein and left subclavian vein, sustained during the lead extraction. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">No identified issues of care have, on balance, caused or made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to her death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Gemma died on 22.8.24 at the City Hospital in Nottingham following a pacemaker Lead Extraction procedure.</span> During the advancement of the Tightrail cutting sheath used to cut through fibrous scar tissue surrounding the lead, to aid lead extraction, the cutting blades likely caused two tears in the wall of the left subclavian and left innominate veins. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: between">These tears occurred at sometime between 14.35 and Gemma's collapse with low blood pressure at 14.48 hours on that day.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: mechanism + mechanism">Whilst the exact mechanism of venous tearing is unclear, and is a very unusual occurrence, the vein walls were likely to be additionally vulnerable because of the stuck fibrous tissue around the pacemaker lead also being stuck to the vein inner wall.</span> No evidence of careless or incorrect technique has been established to have led to these tears. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: higher">Bleeding from these tears was catastrophic, likely the most significant bleed being from the higher tear in the subclavian vein, where the Tightrail sheath was found protruding from the vein at 16.55 hours.</span> The first venous tear was found at 16.11.hours. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: higher + team">Managing events from 14.48 onwards was challenging for the team of senior clinicians present, as there was a need to search for and potentially deal with, a more common bleeding site, that is from the Right Atrium or from a Superior Vena Cava tear, before a higher venous tear was considered.</span> Rendering all appropriate resuscitative measures, including cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary before further bleeding sites were searched for, as Gemma had such a profound circulatory collapse with a cardiac arrest at 15.00 hours requiring ongoing cardiac compressions and full and continuing advanced life support. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: concerns + situation">The extent of bleeding from the venous tears was likely unsurvivable once it had occurred, although it was entirely appropriate to continue all measures to try and save Gemma's life up until sadly the situation was futile with evidence of established multi organ failure later that evening. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The lack of a formalised documented system of risk stratification for Lead extraction. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: staff support + clear + planning + staff + team">The consequence is that there is a lack of clear planning for what may be needed from the cardiac surgical team, in terms of urgent surgical expertise, theatre staff support and perfusion team support, for any given lead extraction 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Keywords: team + attendance">The lack of clarity as to how the full cardiac surgical team can within their resources currently, or planned for, provide necessary attendance in a timely way at a given Lead extraction procedure, as per international expert consensus I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4 th September 2025.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The family I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 10 th July 2025 Dr E. A. Didcock

Deceased name: Jairus Earl
Coroners name: Rachael Griffin
Coroners Area: Dorset
Category: Child Death (from 2015) | Suicide (from 2015)
This report is being sent to: Home Office | Department of Health and Social Care
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Secretary of State for the Home Department 2. Secretary of State for Health 1 CORONER I am Rachael Clare Griffin, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of Dorset. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 16 th April 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Jairus Joshua Timothy Earl, born on the 8 th June 2008, who was aged 15 years at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 1 st July 2025. The medical cause of death was: Ia Fatal shotgun injury to the head The conclusion of the Inquest was suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jairus was 15 years old when he died on the 14 th April 2024. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care">He had a history of mental ill health and had been under the care of his General Practitioner, a Chartered Psychologist and a Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.</span> He had disclosed to them thoughts of ending his life and although he had no plans to do so, he had talked about methods of doing this which included shooting. His father, who Jairus resided with, was a shotgun licence holder. Jairus enjoyed outdoor life and would go out with his father and other family members shooting. The family resided in London, which is where the shotgun licence was held, however they had another home in Dorset. At the end of March 2024, the family travelled to Dorset to spend some time together at their home in Dorset. They took with them a number of shotguns which were then placed in a secure cabinet at the home address in Dorset. Dorset Police were not advised of the location of these guns in the Dorset area as there is no current legal requirement to notify the force where additional places of residence may be. On the 14 th April 2024 Jairus and his father were due to return to their home in London and were closing down the property. Jairius' father was in the process of packing the guns into his car to transport them to London when Jairus went into the office at the property where he used one of the shotguns to end his life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation the evidence provided revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: gaps">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) I have concerns in relation to gaps in the regulation of shotgun licences especially when a licence holder has more than one property where the guns may be used or stored.</span> The Firearms Act 1968 (The Act) is the primary legislation that governs the possession and handing of firearms. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: guidance + review + national, guidance">Evidence was given at the Inquest by Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] of Dorset Police who works within the Dorset Firearms and Explosive Licensing Unit and also works with the College of Policing and the national Firearms & Explosive Licencing Working Group to review and update the Home Office statutory guidance and support the national training effort in response to the Prevention of Future Deaths report from the Inquest touching upon the deaths in Keyham on 12 th August 2021.</span> He gave evidence that the regulation for shotguns is different to the regulations for firearms which is governed by Section 1 of The Act. There seems to be a great deal of difference in the regulation of firearms and the regulation of shotguns, however both can equally cause death. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Supervision and Leadership

Keywords: areas">For example, he explained that there is no obligation on a licence holder of a shotgun licence to notify the approving force they are moving to or visiting another property In his written evidence to the Court, which was further expanded on orally at the Inquest, he explained: "Under section 26B(1) of the 1968 Act, an application for the grant of a shotgun shall be made to the chief officer of police where the applicant resides, there is nothing within the firearms act to define a residence or when applicants have properties in different force areas, the non-statutory guide tells me that where an applicant has a residences in different force areas, it is for the individual to decide which force issues their certificate.</span> Shotgun certificates are issued by individual forces' and will display the force crest and signature of the chief officer of the issuing force, however they are valid throughout England and Wales, and allows the holder to travel with their shotguns anywhere in the United Kingdom. ... Shotgun certificates differ from firearm certificates in a number of ways, for firearms, possession of each and every gun must satisfy individual good reason, whereas a good reason for a shotgun is a collective term, and more relaxed, for example a request for a firearms certificate for target shooting will require that the applicant is a member of a Home Office approved club and shoots regularly, whereas a mere intention to undertake clay pigeon shooting would satisfy good reason for a shotgun certificate. A shotgun certificate also will also authorise a person to have in their possession, purchase or acquire and unlimited number of shotguns without the need for approval in respect of individual guns, that is to say that so long as the shotguns are stored securely a person may have as many as they want. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: record">Another nuance of the shotgun certificate is the '72-hour rule' that it will allow a certificate holder to borrow a shotgun for up to 72 hours without the need to have to record the shotgun on the certificate or notify the police of the transfer. ...</span> Section 28(2)(a) of the 1968 Act provides that a shotgun certificate is granted subject to any prescribed conditions, and no others, that is that these conditions must be applied to the certificate, but the chief officer cannot add additional conditions. .... There is no onus on an applicant to notify another force area where they hold a certificate and have another address in that force area, this is only the case if the certificate holder changes their permanent address that this would be captured by the third condition. There is also no obligation on a certificate holder to notify a chief officer of police when they intent to visit another force area in possession of their shotguns. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Deceased name: Shaun Marriott
Coroners name: Joanne Andrews
Coroners Area: West Sussex, Brighton and Hove
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Joanne ANDREWS, Area Coroner for the coroner area of West Sussex, Brighton and Hove 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST Mr Marriott elected to undergo a haemorrhoidal artery ligation with mucopexy surgery following consultations with his surgeon. He underwent a pre-assessment for the surgery on 30 March 2024 which was conduced by telephone using the assessment on the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Cerner system. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: conditions + medical history">During the assessment he was asked about his family medical history and his own history of haematological conditions.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: conditions">He was not asked about his family history of haematological conditions directly as this is not required by the system.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: patient + medical history">The evidence to the Court was that the clinicians relied upon the patient's response to their family medical history question to ascertain this.</span> The evidence was that Mr Marriott was aware of his significant family history of blood clotting disorders. The evidence from clinicians who assessed him was that this was not disclosed to them. The family believe that he did make this known but there is no evidence which indicates when, where or to whom this was made. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: documentation">The evidence was that he had not been directly asked about this and it was not stated on his notes or GP documentation.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: guidance + guidance">He was given compression stockings as per the Trust guidance as well as mechanical calf compression during the procedure which was above what the guidance required.</span> On 15 April 2024 he sadly died at home. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">A post mortem found he died due to a Pulmonary embolism which on the evidence was a result of the surgery. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: patient + record">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence was that the system which is used for assessment of patients prior to day surgery does not (a) directly require a question to be asked about their haematological family history or (b) record negative answers to the questions related to the patient's own haematolgical history 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 4, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: The family of Mr Marriott I have also sent it to Moatfield Surgery who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Peter Ramsden
Coroners name: Paul Marks

This report is being sent to: Home Office
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Secretary of State for the Home Department - [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Professor Paul Marks, Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area of City of Kingston Upon Hull and the County of the East Riding of Yorkshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 st March 2025, I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Ramsden, aged 74 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 th June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was: NATURAL CAUSES 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Peter Ramsden had a past medical history of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidaemia, poor mobility and chronic alcohol excess.</span> He had not been seen for approximately two months by his neighbours who became concerned about his welfare. Entry to his unlocked premises took place on 2nd January 2025 where he was found deceased and in an advanced state of decomposition. There were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding his death. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Whilst no named specific disease process can be identified to account for his death, on balance, it was due to a natural disease process. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Evidence was heard that there is a lacuna in the law, specifically relating to section 17 of the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) which grants police officers the power to enter and search premises without a warrant in specific situations. These include, inter alia, entry for arrest and emergency situations which allows entry to save life or limb or prevent serious damage to a property. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

A Regulation 28 Report - Action to Prevent Future Deaths THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Home Secretary 2. [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER Ms Anna Loxton, HM Assistant Coroner for Surrey 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners and Justice Act 2009. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST Andrew Nathan Paul Kenward died on 24 th October 2022, aged 30.</span> His inquest was opened on 2 nd May 2023. A summary inquest took place on 17 th June 2025. I recorded a conclusion of Suicide. I found the medical cause of death to be: 1a. [REDACTED] Toxicity 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Early on the morning of 24 th October 2022, Andrew Kenward was found deceased in his car parked on a road in Sunbury on Thames, Surrey, from an overdose of a poisonous substance, namely [REDACTED]. Mr Kenward had previously expressed an intention to end his life to a friend and an undated note was found in his bedroom drawer expressing his regret and love for his Family, but that he felt unable to continue living. Two packets of [REDACTED] were also found in Mr Kenward's bedroom, both stated to contain 50g [REDACTED]. One of these was sealed and weighed 51.45g. The second was resealable and weighed 49.48g. The states purity was "99.999% pure". <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are reportable substances under the Poisons Act 1972.</span> The only obligation under this legislation is that domestic sellers must report reasonable grounds for believing transactions are suspicious. Whilst the source of this particular [REDACTED] is not currently known, there are no restrictions on the import of [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] from abroad. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> OSG [REDACTED] 2. HM Prison & Probation Service (HMPPS) 3. Ministry of Justice (MOJ) 4. The Governing Governor, HMP Woodhill 1 CORONER I am Crispin Giles BUTLER, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Buckinghamshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 06 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of George EMMETT aged 25. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that recorded by the jury was that George's death was drug-related. The Medical Cause of Death Was: 1a) Toxic Effects of Synthetic Cannabinoid II) Coronary Artery Atheroma 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The jury recorded in relation to when, where, how and in what circumstances George came by his death: Mr George Emmett died after taking synthetic cannabinoid in G-Wing at HMP Aylesbury on 25th May 2023. The death was verified by attending paramedics at 21.38 on that day. On 25th May 2023, George was last observed alive in his cell at 18.17. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Emergency preparedness + Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the evidence in person of Operational Support Grade (OSG) [REDACTED], he discussed his actions at the time of and after first seeing George on the floor in his cell. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Emergency preparedness + Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: access + concerns + team">For example, it must not be a requirement for a member of the prison healthcare team or a Duty Manager to attend the scene before emergency services are called; 5.3 It is essential that an ambulance is called in all cases where there are serious concerns about the health of a prisoner and that access to both the prison and the individual prisoner is not delayed; 5.4: A representative NHS Ambulance guide for use in the community states that an ambulance should be called when there are signs of chest pain, difficulty in breathing, unconsciousness, severe blood loss, severe burns or scalds, choking, fitting or concussion, severe allergic reactions or a suspected stroke.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Ministry of Justice Central & North West London NHS Foundation Trust Forward Trust Duncan Lewis Solicitors on Behalf of the Family I have also sent it to The Governing Governor, HMP Aylesbury Prisons and Probation Ombudsman South Central Ambulance Service who may find it useful or of interest.

Deceased name: Patrick Coffey
Coroners name: Robert Simpson
Coroners Area: Berkshire
Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . CEO - Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Robert SIMPSON, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Berkshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 01 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patrick Anthony COFFEY aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 29th September 2024 Patrick Anthony Coffey died at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough. He fell at home on the 12th September fracturing multiple ribs and remained on the floor until the following day contracting a chest infection. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">He was admitted to hospital for treatment but continued to deteriorate. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH As a result of falling at home Mr Coffey fractured multiple ribs and remained on the floor for about 17 hours.</span> On arrival at hospital he was found to have contracted a chest infection. He suffered from COPD which did not usually affect his life and he was mobile prior to the fall. He was assessed in hospital and it was decided to treat the fractures conservatively. This required effective pain control which was not always offered or achieved. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">He did undergo 2 periods of local anaethesia infusions which were more effective in controlling the pain.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He was treated with anitbiotics for the chest infection throughout his stay. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) I heard evidence that it was important that Mr Coffey spent most of his time in a seated position rather than lying down.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: patient + patient">This was to assist with his ability to breathe more deeply and cough more effectively; both of which are of importance when treating chest infections especially in the context of a patient with rib fractures.</span> The nursing witness for the trust confirmed that Mr Coffey should have been repositioned every 2-4 hours. It had been identified by the hospital during random monthly audits that this was either nor being done or not being properly recorded for some patients. Frimley Trust, after the inquest concluded, provided confirmation of when Mr Coffey's position was recorded during his stay. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">These reveal that on certain days almost no information is recorded and on other days it is possible to know his position on a 2-4 hourly basis.</span> Of particular note is the following: 1. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

The entries for the 24/9/24 cease at 14.08 and they do not restart until 12.24 on the 25/9/24 6. The last entry on the 25/9/24 is at 14.35 and the next entry is not until 17.59 on the 26/9/24 7. The final entry on the 26/9/24 is at 20.54 and the first entry on the 27/9/24 is at 10.03. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: gaps">These records therefore have gaps of up to 27 hours.</span> In addition the vast majority of records that do exist do not reveal whether Mr Coffey was actually repositioned as only one position is recorded. It is only on about 7 or 8 occasions that a repositioning has been recorded. The medical records from the hospital do not show repositioning every 2-4 hours and I found that Mr Coffey was probably not repositioned as required. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: contribute">In the particular circumstances of Mr Coffey this did not contribute to his death lack of repositioning does give rise to a risk of future deaths of those suffering from chest infections or, indeed, those particularly at risk of pressure damage. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 01, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The family of Mr Coffey I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Deceased name: Elaine Tarbuck
Coroners name: Timothy Brennand
Coroners Area: Manchester West
Category: Police related deaths
This report is being sent to: Greater Manchester Police | College Of Policing
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED], Chief Constable Greater Manchester Police Divisional Headquarters Building Northampton Road Manchester M40 5BQ 2 [REDACTED], Chief Constable College Of Policing Leamington Road Ryton-on-Dunsmore Coventry CV8 3EN 1 CORONER I am Mr Timothy William Brennand, HM Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Manchester West. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 31 March 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Elaine TARBUCK aged 69. The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 25 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Emergency preparedness + Extended Analysis_Time-Critical Interventions + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: emergency response + emergency response + optimal + pre-existing + medical history">The medical cause of death was: 1a) Exsanguination 1b) Scalp Laceration 2) Ischaemic Heart Disease I returned a narrative conclusion that Elaine Tarbuck died as the consequence of injuries sustained in an accidental fall and the exacerbating effects of pre-existing naturally occurring disease on a background of sub-optimal emergency response. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a medical history that included Multiple Myeloma with reducing mobility, a history of falls (previous pelvic fracture in November 2024) and low mood, depression and anxiety following the recent death of her husband.</span> Such was the nature extent of concern for welfare, her next-of-kin (who resided a long distance from the deceased) would telephone the deceased several times in the day and had also arranged for family friends to visit daily. She was last spoken to during the evening of the 28th of March 2025. At about 9.40am on the morning of 29th of March 2025, a friend of the deceased attended at her residence at [REDACTED], Westhoughton on a pre-arranged welfare visit. Upon obtaining no response from the deceased, he went to the nearest police station to report his concerns. Little Hulton Police Station was unmanned and closed, but public signage giving advice resulted in a call to the police ‘101' non-emergency contact line. The concerned friend was instructed that the matter was a welfare and not a policing matter. At 11.52am having confirmed from family and neighbours that the deceased had not been seen and was still not responding to telephone calls to her, the emergency services were contacted via a ‘999' call. Call handlers determined that an ambulance should attend. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Emergency paramedics arrived on scene at 12.18pm but could not gain access to the deceased's property.</span> The Fire Service was therefore requested to attend. Following a forced entry via rear patio doors at 12.50pm the deceased was discovered in a collapsed, unresponsive condition at the foot of the stairs laying in a pool of dried blood from an obvious head injury. She was verified as dead and beyond any attempted resuscitation. The evidence established that after setting the house alarms and heading up the stairs for bed during the preceding evening, the deceased had missed her footing or lost her balance, falling backwards from about three stairs up, landing in a way that caused her to lose immediate consciousness and having also sustained a laceration to her head, thereafter was to exsanguinate without re-gaining consciousness. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: quality + care + information + care + assessment">By reason of the time at which death could be established, it was determined that accepted suboptimal elements in the assessment, quality of questions asked of people contacting the police and emergency services and the resulting information gathering fell below the standard expected and applied as part of the ‘Right Care, Right Person' response policy, this did not have any bearing upon the outcome. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the Inquest, evidence was heard that: 1. Family members who lived far from the deceased became concerned for the welfare of the deceased and were of the view that she had suffered a medical episode, collapse or adverse event that explained her failure to respond to telephone calls and knocks on the door from friends. 2. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Physical characteristics
Keywords: physical + risk + physical">The full background of the deceased, her history of falls, her recent bereavement and high risk to have suffered an adverse medical episode, or deliberate or unintended physical harm raised the expectation on the part of the family, that having called the emergency services, entry would be forced to the deceased's residence as they were of the view that there was a real and immediate risk of death or serious harm having occurred. 3.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations

Deceased name: Sean Fitzgerald
Coroners name: Sir John Saunders
Coroners Area: Coventry and Warwickshire

This report is being sent to: College of Policing | West Midlands Police
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing, [REDACTED] Rugby Building Leamington Road Ryton-On-Dunsmore Coventry CV8 3EN The Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, [REDACTED] Police Headquarters, Lloyd House Colmore Circus Queensway Birmingham B4 6NQ 1 CORONER I am Sir John Saunders, a former judge of the High Court. Under paragraph 3 of Schedule 10 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, I was nominated by the Lady Chief Justice to conduct an investigation and inquest into the death of Sean Patrick Fitzgerald ("Mr Fitzgerald"). <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Following that nomination, I have exercised the functions of senior coroner in the coroner area of Coventry and Warwickshire in relation to the investigation and inquest. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under: (a) Paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5) ; and (b) Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made) . 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST This investigation concerns the death of Mr Fitzgerald, who was fatally shot by a West Midlands Police ("WMP") officer (known as Officer K) on 4 January 2019 during an armed operation at a residential address in Coventry.</span> The investigation commenced on 10 January 2019 and concluded at the end of an inquest hearing on 21 May 2025. In summary, the conclusions at the end of the hearing were as follows: (a) The medical cause of death was: 1a. Gunshot Wound of the Chest. (b) The jury returned a short-form conclusion of death by lawful killing, supplemented with (i) a narrative setting out the circumstances of death and (ii) answers to two supplementary questions which concerned the planning and preparation, and the implementation, of the police firearms operation. The jury's narrative and answers to the two questions are set out in the next section of this report. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATHS The jury returned a supplementary narrative as to the circumstances of Mr Fitzgerald's death, as follows: "On 4 January 2019, Sean Fitzgerald was at a house at [REDACTED] in Coventry. A team of police firearms officers from West Midlands Police arrived at the house to perform a search warrant. At shortly after 6.20pm, officers at the front of the house began using a chainsaw to break down the front door. At this point, Sean Fitzgerald went to the back door, opened it and emerged. A police firearms officer in position about 7.5 feet from the back door discharged his firearm towards Sean Fitzgerald. The shot struck him in the chest and caused serious internal injuries. Despite prompt first aid from police officers and from paramedics and a doctor, it was not possible to resuscitate him, and he died of the gunshot wound. He was declared dead at 6.55pm." The first supplementary question asked: "Do you consider that there was any failure in the planning and preparation for the police firearms operation on 4 January 2019 which may have or did materially contribute to Sean Fitzgerald's death?" The jury answered "Yes" to the first question, providing the following explanation: "1. We are unanimously agreed on the following failures in planning and preparation. It was important that the planning should have stated that MOE [method of entry] would not commence until [Officers] K & F had verbally confirmed they were in place on rear containment. This was a missed opportunity 2. Due to the lack of intelligence on the rear of the property and the surrounding alleyway, it is a serious omission in standard procedure to not consider and assign secondary roles to a certain number of AFO's [authorised firearms officers] should officers F & K request assistance at the rear. 3. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: concerns, seriously + inadequate">Due to the nature of the MOE used, it was seriously inadequate that the Armed Police challenge is not announced before the commencement of MOE." The second supplementary question asked: "Do you consider that there was any failure in the implementation of the police firearms operation on 4 January 2019 which may have or did materially contribute to Sean Fitzgerald's death?" The jury answered "Yes" to the second question, providing the following explanation: "- We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in choosing the positions they took up based on the briefing and the intelligence about the property. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in not requesting the deployment of further officers to the rear based on the briefing. - We unanimously agree that the officers should have announced ‘Armed Police' on the front of the premises, earlier than they did, at a point before MOE [method of entry] commenced. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that officers K + F should have announced Armed Police on the rear of the premises at the point the curtain moved behind the rear door. - We agree on a majority of 10-1 that officers K & F should have turned on their torches at the rear of the property at the point MOE [method of entry] commenced on the front door." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In these circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: concerns">Although firearms operations by their nature vary, my concerns have broad application because they relate to the performance of commonly used tactics and to general principles which apply in armed policing.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: processing + guidance + national, local, guidance">In considering these matters, I have taken account of evidence from (a) the officers involved; (b) witnesses with experience of local and national training, policies and guidance (including senior firearms training officers); and (c) a range of experts who gave evidence on topics including (i) the conduct of police tactics and (ii) the operation of human perception, cognition and visual processing.</span> Given the risks to life inherent in armed policing, both to the officers and to members of the public, it is important that firearms officers are given the best possible training and support to perform their role. I hope that this report will be considered carefully. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) Training and practice in relation to timing of any announcement of "armed police" in police firearms operations involving containment of properties In the police operation in which Mr Fitzgerald was killed, the officers employed the tactic of "contain and call out with limited entry." This involves firearms officers "containing" a property by surrounding it and providing firearms cover with their weapons; creating a breach by forcing entry; and "calling out" the subjects inside (directing them to leave through the point of breach), without the officers themselves entering. In evidence, it was explained that this is a very common tactic, which is used in a range of scenarios. [REDACTED], a former senior firearms officer and armed policing lead within the College of Policing, gave evidence in the inquest. He explained that an integral part of the tactic is for officers to announce their presence by loud shouts of "armed police." This warns those inside the property that it is the police forcing entry and informs them that the officers are armed. It was explained that this warning helps to avoid confusion and encourage compliance, thereby reducing the risk of harm to officers and occupants. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + time + national, guidance">The timing of the announcement is plainly important, and any potential for confusion or for making the announcement at the wrong time risks fatal consequences. [REDACTED] said that the timing of any such announcement is not prescribed by national training or guidance, and that there is no "template" for when it should be done, although he understood that it would usually be made after achieving a breach (e.g. breaking down a door).</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + national, guidance">The procedural and training documents (both national and from WMP) which were put in evidence in the inquest gave no detailed guidance on the subject.</span> The Chief Firearms Instructor at WMP, [REDACTED], gave evidence that WMP trains its officers to make the announcement after achieving a breach. The evidence of the officers involved in the operation as to the recommended or standard practice was inconsistent. The Strategic Firearms Commander said that he expected officers to announce themselves as armed police as soon as they were in position. The Operational Firearms Commander said that the shout should first be made as soon as the chainsaw was being applied to the door and again as the breach was made. One further member of the team said that he thought best practice was to give the shout as the chainsaw was being applied, but he acknowledged that he had not done so on this occasion. Several other members of the team thought that proper practice was only to make the announcement after the door had been breached. The firearms briefing told the officers that method of entry would be conducted and "[o]nce breached, challenges will be made at the threshold and suspects will be handcuffed". There was no further discussion or direction about when the officers should first announce their presence. In the event, the officers at the front of the property did not shout "armed police" before breaking down the two doors at the front of the property. Before any announcement was made, Mr Fitzgerald left through the rear door of the premises and was shot by Officer K, who was providing rear containment. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: clear + guidance + factors + guidance">In these circumstances, I am concerned that the guidance and training given to firearms officers on tactics of containing and entering properties (and specifically in relation to the containment and call out with limited entry tactic) does not ensure a clear and consistent understanding of when they should announce their presence, or what factors to consider in deciding when to make the announcement.</span> I am also concerned that the topic was not the subject of more specific discussion or direction in the briefing. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: clear">If the approach of different officers is inconsistent, there is the clear potential for mistakes to be made and for the lives of officers and others to be put at risk.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: guidance + between + guidance + trained">However, the inconsistent views of highly trained officers which were given in this inquest indicate that the subject ought to be further addressed in training and in formal guidance. (2) Training and practice in relation to positioning of firearms officers in operations against properties (including consideration of the reactionary gap) As set out above, in this case, Officer K was standing between 7 and 8 feet from the rear door of the property as Mr Fitzgerald left.</span> He discharged his firearm within just over half a second of the door beginning to open. The jury found that he had acted lawfully, meaning that he had perceived a threat and had used force commensurate with the threat he perceived. They also found that he had acted reasonably in taking up the position which he took, given the briefing he had received. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: psychological">In the inquest, two experts in cognition and perception, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], explained that close proximity to a potential source of danger can have a psychological impact, significantly elevating a person's perception of threat and potentially increasing the likelihood that they will respond with force.</span> The experts considered that, in this case, such proximity was likely to have heightened Officer K's perception of threat. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Staff Training and Education

Keywords: information + time">In evidence, [REDACTED] discussed this concept, explaining that distance gives officers more time to assimilate information and respond to an approaching threat.

Keywords: guidance + guidance">The firearms training and guidance materials considered in evidence made limited reference to positioning and the reactionary gap.</span> The WMP training materials required students to demonstrate an appropriate reactionary gap in one training exercise and to explain its importance in another. <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: stress">The College of Policing's Authorised Professional Practice on Armed Containment described the benefit of distance, but in terms of reducing stress, tension and the likelihood of a close quarter confrontation.</span> None of the materials gave any detailed consideration to the risks presented by close proximity (including close proximity to entrances rather than subjects) in the context of armed containment of properties. None explained the potential impact of proximity on threat perception and the likelihood that an officer will respond with potentially lethal force. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">I am concerned that the training and guidance given to firearms officers on how to position themselves, especially in operations against properties, does not include detailed consideration of the risks of taking up position in close proximity to entrances.</span> It does not appear to address the effects of proximity on threat perception and the use of force. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: guidance + guidance">As with the first matter of concern, I recognise that it should be for expert firearms training officers to decide how to deal with this subject in training and guidance, and that there will inevitably be situations where a firearms officer has to take up position very close to a doorway or other entrance when containing a property.</span> However, there appears to be a need for further consideration of this issue in the interest of minimising the risks of mistake of fact shootings in the future. <span style="background-color:#F5F5DC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: stress">Finally, I should stress that in raising this matter of concern, I am not detracting from the jury's conclusions that Officer K's use of force was lawful and that his decision on where to position himself was reasonable in light of the briefing and intelligence. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe that the College of Policing and West Midlands Police are bodies which have the power to take such action.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The second supplementary question asked: "Do you consider that there was any failure in the implementation of the police firearms operation on 4 January 2019 which may have or did materially contribute to Sean Fitzgerald's death?" The jury answered "Yes" to the second question, providing the following explanation: "- We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in choosing the positions they took up based on the briefing and the intelligence about the property. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that [Officers] K & F acted reasonably in not requesting the deployment of further officers to the rear based on the briefing. - We unanimously agree that the officers should have announced ‘Armed Police' on the front of the premises, earlier than they did, at a point before MOE [method of entry] commenced. - We agree with a majority of 10-1 that officers K + F should have announced Armed Police on the rear of the premises at the point the curtain moved behind the rear door. - We agree on a majority of 10-1 that officers K & F should have turned on their torches at the rear of the property at the point MOE [method of entry] commenced on the front door." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns.</td>

This report is being sent to: Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group | London Ambulance Service NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group London Ambulance Service NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Sian Reeves, assistant coroner, for the coroner area of South London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15 February 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Miles Brian Robinson, who was aged 66 at the time of his death.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, which was heard over 3 days between 4 and 6 June 2025.</span> The medical cause of death was: 1a. Myocardial Infarction. 1b. Atherosclerosis. 2. End-stage renal failure. The conclusion was natural causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In the early hours of the morning on 19 December 2022, Miles Robinson started to have chest pains and was vomiting. He had multiple co-morbidities including end-stage renal failure, hypertension, heart failure and pleural effusion. His granddaughter called 999 at 03:37. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: allocation">Due to extreme demand on the London Ambulance Service ("LAS"), there was a significant delay in that call and a later 999 call being answered and there were significant delays in allocation and dispatch of ambulances.</span> The 999 call was incorrectly triaged and received an inaccurate categorisation of the urgency of the response required. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: treatment + informed">Having been informed that an emergency ambulance was not immediately required and of the wait times for an ambulance, Mr Robinson made his own way in an Uber to the nearest urgent treatment centre ("UTC") at Queen Mary's Hospital.</span> Upon arrival, he had a cardiac arrest. This was due to a massive myocardial infarction. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">After prolonged CPR and shocks by staff at the UTC and attending LAS paramedics, a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved at 05:04.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Mr Robinson was then transferred by ambulance to the local emergency department at Princess Royal University Hospital ("PRUH").</span> He had two further cardiac arrests shortly before and after his arrival at PRUH, which were fatal. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He died at 06:36 on 19 December 2022. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: prioritisation">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: In the UK, 999 calls are triaged using one of two approved triage tools (also referred to as call prioritisation systems) approved by NHS England: the Medical Priority Dispatch System ("MPDS") and NHS Pathways.</span> LAS uses MPDS. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Resource allocation
Keywords: resource">The MPDS looks at signs and symptoms and prioritises them into dispatch codes, which assign a level of priority to the call, and in turn inform the type of ambulance resource that will be allocated to manage the incident.</span> MPDS is designed for use by non-clinical call handlers. MPDS involves a system of structured questions which identify priority symptoms and thereby the clinical need of patients. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)
Keywords: between + between, patient + patient">The structured questions fall into different protocols and a patient can be shunted, or moved, between one protocol and another depending on the answers to specific questions.</span> In these circumstances, and for sound operational reasons, there is necessarily an element of rigidity in the MPDS. In Mr Robinson's case, LAS accepted that the first 999 call was incorrectly triaged and received an inaccurate categorisation of the urgency of the response required: it was allocated a Category 3 (urgent) rather than Category 2 (emergency) response. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

Deceased name: David Gifford
Coroners name: Debbie Rookes
Coroners Area: Avon
Category: Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: Association of Ambulance Chief Executives
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) 1 CORONER I am Debbie Rookes, Assistant Coroner for the Coroner Area of Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 December 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Stewart Gifford. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural causes The cause of death was recorded as: 1a Ruptured thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm 1b Fractured stent and endoleak 1c Aortic dissection and multiple aortic aneurysms - stented 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH David Gifford had an extensive medical history with significant co-morbidities.</span> He had a long cardiac history which included aortic dissection, multiple aortic aneurysms and heart failure. He first underwent surgery for aortic dissection in 2006. He subsequently underwent further surgery on multiple occasions for further stenting and grafting to repair additional ruptures to his aorta. He developed an endoleak which was monitored and remained stable for many years, until it required surgery in 2023. Mr Gifford died on 26 November 2024 at Southmead Hospital. His death was caused by an acute ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, following the development of a fractured stent and endoleak at some point in the weeks preceding his death. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">It was not clear for exactly how long this endoleak had been present, or when the fracture occurred.</span> In the weeks before his death, Mr Gifford had had multiple visits to his GP surgery. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient">He was a complex patient with a number of medical condition and he had been experiencing a range of symptoms.</span> The clinicians he saw referred him for further investigations into his symptoms. In the afternoon of 25 November 2024, Mr Gifford made a 999 call to the ambulance due to right-sided neck pain which radiated down his back and to his flank. He had been experiencing this pain since August 2024. Paramedics attended in the evening, and after an assessment, they did not think he needed to be conveyed to hospital. Worsening advice was given which resulted in Mr Gifford calling 999 again late that evening and an ambulance arrived in the early hours of 26 November 2024. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">He was conveyed to hospital and then transferred to Southmead Hospital, where he lost cardiac output whilst still on the trolley. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

Keywords: conditions + training">Whilst there may be many medical conditions that could be similar, there does not seem to be much focus given to the identification of vascular emergencies within training and knowledge updates.</span> Therefore when paramedics attend emergencies, in the absence of classic symptoms, they may be wrongly reassured. Where a person has an extensive aortic history, the importance of aortic pathology should be considered. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to [REDACTED], son, and [REDACTED], daughter-in-law of the deceased, and to the Chief Coroner. I have also sent a copy to South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. I am also under a duty to send the chief coroner a copy of your response. The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

MITIE 1 CORONER I am Mrs. Lydia Brown Senior Coroner for West London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 30 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Frank Steve Rios OSPINA.

Keywords: treatment + time + record">Rule 35 (2) states 2. ‘The medical practitioner shall report to the manager on the case of any detained person he suspects of having suicidal intentions, and the detained person shall be placed under special observation for so long as those suspicions remain, and a record of his treatment and condition shall be kept throughout that time in a manner to be determined by the Secretary of State. ‘The manager shall send a copy of any report under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) to the Secretary of State without delay.</span> Despite Frank Ospina being witnessed as having made an attempt to take his life, and self- reporting a further attempt during his detention, no R35 report was made. The GP evidence was that there was a long waiting list of 4 weeks of over 100 individuals who were dealt with in separate dedicated surgeries, that he had only made "a small number" of R35 (2) reports and that he would usually await and rely on additional evidence such as that from a Consultant Psychiatrist before submitting a R35 (2) report. In contrast, the Home Office evidence was that they were "surprised" that a R35 report had not been submitted. If it had been it would have been considered by a responsible officer within 2 working days. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Secretary of State for Health & Social Care 1 CORONER I am Debbie Rookes, Assistant Coroner for the Coroner Area of Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 27 August 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Sarah Jayne Lewis.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest today, on 7 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide The cause of death was recorded as: 1a Acute toxicity of [REDACTED] 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In 2014, Sarah Lewis was diagnosed with Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Ms Lewis' ME was severe and as a result of her condition, she experienced severe and debilitating symptoms. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: quality">This had a huge effect on her quality of life, and left her for the most part bedbound.</span> It also impacted on her ability to seek professional support or be supported due to sensory sensitivity and aversion to visiting, or being visited. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">Ms Lewis had a history of anxiety and depression but this complex multisystem condition resulted in a deterioration of her mental health and left her wishing that she was no longer alive.</span> On 8 August 2024, it was Severe ME Awareness Day. Ms Lewis was found deceased at home on 9 August 2024 but as she had not been seen for 2 days, it is likely she died the day before, on a day which was significant for her. Her death was caused by her taking an overdose of [REDACTED] with the intention of ending her own life. By ending her own life, she also ended the profound physical and mental suffering that she had endured. I heard that due to the severe nature of her illness, nothing could really be done to help her. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">She was therefore left knowing that there is no real treatment for ME, and there is no cure.</span> <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: areas">Whilst there is an ME/CFS service provided by North Bristol , there are areas of the country where there is no provision. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1) Despite ME having received some more recent attention, the provision of ME services around the country remains inconsistent. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: areas">I understand that there are still areas where there is no provision.</span> The evidence revealed that a very important first stage for ME sufferers is that they receive a diagnosis and validation for their severe symptoms. Without provision of a service, there remains a risk that this will not occur. I was told that there is still a belief by some that ME is not real and this has a profoundly negative effect on sufferers and their ability to seek support. 2) Historically, there has been little research into ME. As a result of this, nobody knows what causes it, and there is therefore no cure. Whilst I note there has been a small investment recently in research, I was told that this is not enough, and that a perception remains about ME not being real. The resultant effect is that some ME sufferers have no hope that their symptoms will ever improve. 3) Other professionals do not understand ME, what it is or the symptoms it causes. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: treatment + care + care + care + barrier">This can be a barrier to those with ME receiving support, or accessing care/treatment they need.</span> A hospital passport is now being utilised at North Bristol, which assists sufferers. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation

Keywords: care, clear + guidance + care + care + guidance + training, education">Education and training about this has not been prioritised. 4) NICE issued update guidance relatively recently but it is not clear whether this has been fully considered or implemented by commissioning bodies around the country. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to [REDACTED], father of the Deceased, and to North Bristol NHS Trust, whose witness gave evidence at the inquest. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

The chief coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Royal Cornwall Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Executive Officer Royal Cornwall Hospital 1 CORONER I am Guy Davies, His Majesty's Assistant Coroner for Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 28 March 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of 54-year-old Jason James Clemens. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 June 2025. The medical cause of death has been established on the evidence as follows 1a Pneumonia 1b Cystic Fibrosis II Renal Failure (on dialysis) The four questions - who, when, where and how - were answered as follows ... <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: prescription + time">Jason James CLEMENS died on 23 March 2024 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro from complications following cystic fibrosis contributed to by a delay in the administration of antibiotics from the time of prescription.</span> Antibiotics were prescribed to be administered without delay at 18:15 hours on 22 March 2024. There was a 7-hour delay before antibiotics were administered at 01:20 hours on 23 March 2024. Jason became unresponsive at 05:00 hours and died at 06:30 hours on 23 March 2024. There were a number of missed opportunities to identify the requirement to administer antibiotics. This delay likely hastened Jason's death and more than minimally contributed to Jason's cause of death. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows Natural causes contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH There were four missed opportunities to administer antibiotics. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: patient">Jason suffered a medical episode during the afternoon of 22 March 2024 whilst attending an out-patient appointment at the renal unit of RCHT.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: review + staff + staff">Staff took clinical readings and requested a medical review which was completed by a renal registrar at 18:15 hours that day.</span> The registrar gave instructions on Jason's medical management plan which required a full sepsis screen and the immediate administration of antibiotics. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">This was reinforced by the registrar completing a without delay prescription of antibiotics on the digital system (known as EPMA).</span> Subsequently there were four missed opportunities to administer antibiotics before they were administered at 01:20 hours following day, 23 March 2024. Jason was found unresponsive at 05:00 and died at 06:30 on that day. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: prescription + review">The four missed opportunities were as follows 1) The renal registrar did not verbally instruct the nursing team to administer antibiotics at 18:15 hours. 2) The renal unit nurses either disregarded or did not read the registrar review and the management plan and EPMA prescription requiring immediate administration of antibiotics. 3) At 22:15 there was a handover from renal unit to acute medical unit (AMU).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: prescription + record">The renal unit nurses did not record on the handover notes the requirement to administer antibiotics. 4) On handover the AMU nurses either disregarded or did not check the management plan and EPMA prescription requiring the administration of antibiotics.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review
Keywords: review">The error was discovered on registrar review in the AMU at 00:10 hours the next day but there was then a further inexplicable delay.</span> Antibiotics were administered at 01:20 hours, Jason became unresponsive at 05:00 and died shortly thereafter. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">The court found that these were basic errors and that the delay in the administration of antibiotics likely hastened Jason's death and more than minimally contributed to Jason's cause of death . 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The hospital accepted that there were failings that contributed to Jason's death. Measures to address those failings had not been fully implemented at the date of the Inquest. There were no applicable standard operating procedures for worsening patients in the renal unit at the date of Jason's death and none had been implemented by the date of Inquest. Jason died on 23 March 2024. The inquest was held on 5 June 2025. The court was told that the standard operating procedures are still being drafted in relation to identifying the appropriate pathway for the admission of worsening patients in the renal unit.

The following day Monday 18th (second day of illness) his wife rang Carlisle Central Practice to request a GP appointment; she was told that no appointments were available and advised to ring NHS 111 for advice after 6pm that evening (not before because her call would be referred back to the practice where there were no appointments!). <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">Thomas remained unwell so his wife called 111 and after an assessment and callback an hour later an ambulance was sent.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication, prescription">The emergency medical technician assessed Thomas fully, all his observations were normal and so he was left with advice to try the GP practice again the following day if symptoms persisted On Tuesday 19th (third day of illness) Thomas was no better, his wife did receive a telephone appointment from the GP practice and was issued a prescription for an anti- diarrhoeal medication.</span> On Wednesday 20th (fourth day of illness) Thomas was getting weaker and had soiled due to the diarrhoea. 111 was called again at 5.30 pm and she was told that she had secured the last GP telephone appointment of the day at 6.30: that call never came. Getting desperate his wife rang 999 just before midnight, help was not sent but she was told a doctor from Cumbria Health (the out of hours provider) would call back within 2 hours: despite waiting up until 4am that call never came either. On Thursday 21st (fifth day of illness). "After another terrible night of continuous vomiting and diarrhoea" the GP surgery was again called and an afternoon telephone appointment offered. "Utterly exasperated stressed and traumatized" his wife again tried 999 and this time an ambulance was sent. Thomas collapsed shortly after the crew arrived, they recognized how ill he was and took him to hospital immediately. On arrival in A&E Thomas was found to be hypotensive and hypothermic with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) To SSP Health, owners and operators of Carlisle Central Practice, 65 Warwick Road, Carlisle. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)

Keywords: assessment">It was acknowledged that on 18th the advice "to call back tomorrow" should never have been given and that the telephone appointment the following day really ought to have been a face to face assessment either in surgery or at Thomas's home.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: elderly">I am concerned that no body or organization has taken responsibility for Thomas, an elderly man with significant co- morbidities, during his illness.</span> Should this responsibility ultimately rest with a patients general practitioner, if not where does it rest? (2) To Cumbria Health (CH). Thomas's case was sent electronically to the service, marked for 2 hour attention. I appreciate why this did not take place as it was impossible for clinicians on night duty to triage a large number of calls waiting while actually visiting and treating their caseload. I note a new "OPEL" system has since been instituted to try to escalate and get extra help as the number of calls waiting increases, but where will these extra resources come from overnight? I am also concerned that the referral from NWAS came as a result of a 999 emergency phone call but there seemed to be no way of telling NWAS that the call had not been dealt with and (presumably) passing responsibility back to them. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: providers">As referred to above -where does responsibility lie? (3) To Northwest Ambulance Service (NWAS) as providers of both 111 and 999 responses in Cumbria.</span> There were multiple calls to 111 and 999 in this case. I was told that there was no alert to a call handler to indicate recent contacts for the same patient with the same condition which might highlight a need for more decisive action. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: agency">I am also concerned that (as above) there is no system that alerts your control to the fact that a 999 (emergency) case you have passed to another agency has not in fact been dealt with.</span> A further concern refers specifically to the 111 service. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">At inquest it was questioned whether for out of hours GP services Cumbria had been better served when calls went to a local control room in Carlisle.

Keywords: care + care + care">In my summing up after hearing the evidence in this case I explained the legal concept of neglect as a failure to provide basic care and (in this case) medical attention for someone in a dependent condition who can not provide it for himself, and I remarked that I felt Thomas "had fallen through an overcomplex system and was indeed neglected".</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + needs + care + care">I am aware that you are hoping to develop a 10 year plan for the NHS and therefore feel it my duty to highlight this case to you as an example of how overcomplexity has lost sight of a man's urgent care needs. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organizations have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27th August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Thomas's widow [REDACTED] and their daughter [REDACTED]. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 30 June 2025 Signature Dr Nicholas Shaw HM Assistant Coroner for Cumbria.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Health NHS England Stepping Hill Hospital 1 CORONER Christopher Murray HM Assistant Coroner Manchester South Coronial Area Mount Tabor Stockport 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 st March 2024 an investigation was opened into the death of Neil John Clarke aged 81 years.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 st May 2025. Sitting without a jury I made a determination that Neil John Clark died as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, aspiration pneumonia and infarcted bowel arising as a consequence of aspiration secondary to vomiting which precipitated a cardiac arrest following a right hemicolectomy. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Neil Clarke was a fit 81 year old who was investigated by way of colonoscopy following reports of bowel discomfort. A colonoscopy and polypectomy were carried out on 12th December 2022. Two polyps were removed and were benign. A repeat colonoscopy on 29th August 2023 showed recurrence of a polyp in the caecum. Endoscopic mucosal resection polypectomy failed. A discussion in MDT took place and the consensus was to proceed with a right hemicolectomy. The options provided to Mr Clarke were conservative management, further polypectomy or a right hemicolectomy. The latter was advised as the most appropriate option by clinicians as it would involve one invasive procedure rather than two and provide clarity as to the nature of the polyps being cancerous or benign. The surgery carried out on 12th February 2024 at Stepping Hill Hospital was uneventful save for some post operative bleeding. Once stabilised he was transferred to ward D5 on 15th February 2024. He felt unwell that afternoon and vomited. His ward lights were turned out at 23:00 and he was made comfortable. At 02:00 on 16th February he was agitated and then violently vomited before suffering a cardiac arrest. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Deceased name: Barry Spooner
Coroners name: Nathanael Hartley
Coroners Area: Nottingham and Nottinghamshire
Category: Police related deaths
This report is being sent to: Nottinghamshire Police
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police 1 CORONER I am Nathanael Hartley, assistant coroner for the coroner area of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 10 July 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Barry Christopher Spooner, aged 74. The inquest concluded on 17 th June 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: between">I made a determination at inquest that he died as a result of unlawful killing. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Spooner engaged with the police on 7 occasions between 25 May 2021 and 15 May 2023 following concerns raised by himself, and others, about a female.</span> Concerns included that she was exploiting him for his money in order to buy drugs. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: agency">Officers who liaised with him for incidents on 27 August 2021, 10 September 2021, 15 October 2021 and 15 May 2023 completed Public Protection Notices (PPNs) and submitted them to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Of those that were submitted, three were referred onwards to Adult Social Care, but that from 15 October 2021 was not.</span> The Probation Service engaged with the female during the same period up until 22 January 2023. I heard evidence about the manner in which she was managed by the probation service. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: access">Mr Spooner was exploited financially by the female until his death, and she made efforts to access his bank account, most probably after he had died.</span> He was found in his home address having been murdered by the female. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: information + local">Insufficient information sharing from Nottinghamshire Police to the Local Authority in the event of a public protection concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: information + policy + between">I heard evidence about the new Vulnerability Policy followed by the police in order to try to improve information sharing between organisations.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">I was told that when a PPN is completed and sent to the MASH it is considered by an experienced officer who decides whether or not to refer it on to Adult Social Care for their consideration.</span> If they decide not to refer onwards then the officer will consider all PPNs from the previous 12 months. If this review causes them to change their opinion then the current PPN and the previous PPNs will be referred onwards. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + information + care">This ensures Adult Social Care has all relevant information to help them decide upon the best course of action.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor
Keywords: care + care + policy">In accordance with the Vulnerability Policy, it was explained to me that when a PPN is considered suitable for referral to Adult Social Care straight away then previous PPNs are not reviewed and sent on to Adult Social Care if they have not already had them.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: care + information + care + team">This means that in a scenario where there have been previous PPNs that have not been provided to Adult Social Care, then that team will not be aware of all of the relevant information when considering the referral from the MASH and the most appropriate course of action.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">This may impact upon Adult Social Care's ability to make a proper decision in such cases and may put vulnerable people at more of a risk depending upon whether previous PPNs have been provided to Adult Social Care, or not. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26 August, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. Mr Spooner's family 2. The Probation Service 3. Nottingham City Council 4. Independent Office of Police Complaints I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response and all interested persons who, in my opinion, should receive it.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) I read and heard evidence from the investigating CID officer who had reviewed all available CCTV in relation to the incident. She reported that Jody had arrived on the south bound platform just over an hour before she jumped. She sat on a bench for a few minutes before making her way onto [REDACTED]. She was on the [REDACTED] for about one hour before she actually did so. A total of 11 trains passed her, north and southbound, during that hour. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Staff (characteristics and performance)

Keywords: staff + staff + staff">It would be exceeeding the available evidence and unfair to infer that train crews and/or station staff deliberately or negligently ignored her presence there.</span> More likely is that she was simply not visible. It was dark, being at night in April, and Jody was wearing relatively dark clothing. However, she seems to have been discernible on CCTV and from the British Transport Police images I have seen taken from approximately where a driver might have been placed, it is plausible to suggest that she might have been visible, even laterally, from the cab of a train either slowing to stop at the station or pulling out from it, with even moderately enhanced lighting on the viaduct. Obviously, had a report been made of her presence, some type of intervention could have been attempted [REDACTED]. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 27, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED], Jody's Mother [REDACTED], Jody's Aunt who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Chief Executive NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board The Council House First Floor Corporation Street Derby DE1 2FS [REDACTED] 2. [REDACTED], Chief Executive National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 3rd floor 3 Piccadilly Place Manchester M1 3BN [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Peter Nieto, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Derby and Derbyshire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 . 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 17 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aaron ATKINSON aged 36.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: - Unascertained 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Aaron was found deceased on the morning of 20 April 2023 at his home address. His death was completely unexpected. As his cause of death was not known a postmortem examination was conducted including toxicology. The pathologist's opinion was that Aaron had died due to a seizure and positional asphyxia. Aaron's mother was doubtful of the cause of death proposed and pressed for a second postmortem which was undertaken by a different pathologist. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">That pathologist considered that a more likely cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia caused by Aaron's prescription of Risperidone (for behavioural regulation), and Ritalin (for ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).</span> On the court's assessment of the evidence, applying the balance of probabilities, a probable medical cause of death cannot be determined. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: National Highways [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Sean CUMMINGS, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 11 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Leigh NARDELLI aged 46.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 03 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Road traffic collision Road traffic collision 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Leigh Nardelli died on the A5 Southbound in Milton Keynes on the 6th July 2024. He was driving a Mercedes AMG car at speed in torrential rain. There was extensive water pooling on the A5. There was dashcam footage of the vehicle aquaplaning and losing control. <span style="background-color:#D6D8D9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: barrier">The offside of the vehicle hit the central reservation and travelled along it for a distance before hitting a ramped terminal of a further section of restraint barrier.</span> This had been in place to protect the concrete support pillar of an overhead bridge. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">However, it is acutely ramped and allowed Mr Nardelli's vehicle to be projected up it, travel along the top before entering a wider space between the barriers on the south and northside.</span> The vehicle then seems to have descended and "flipped" becoming airborne and striking the concrete support causing fatal injuries. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- Design of Equipment Supplies and Drugs
Keywords: national + design">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The hazard posed by the design of the P1 terminal was known by National Highways and it was due for replacement at the site of the collision in 2022.</span> It presented and continues to present a significant risk and was not replaced for financial reasons. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: safety + national">There is a gradual roll out programme across National Highways to replace P1 terminals with a safer bifurcated system but I consider the implications of the financial limitations represents an ongoing safety concern for vehicles approaching them on designated roads. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 12, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

This report is being sent to: Worcestershire Acute Hospital NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Acting Chief Executive, Worcestershire Acute Hospital NHS Trust ( "the Trust" ), Charles Hastings Way, Worcester WR5 1DD. 1 CORONER I am David Donald William REID, HM Senior Coroner for Worcestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 3 September 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Jordanne Rose ROBERTS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Jordanne "died from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism. Her death was contributed to by neglect" . 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In answer to the questions "when, where and how did Jordanne come by her death?", I recorded as follows: "On 10.8.24 Jordanne Roberts was assessed in the Emergency Department of the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch after falling down stairs at her home in Kidderminster. The locum doctor who assessed her discharged her home without waiting to read a full CT scan report, which identified that she had a pulmonary embolism. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">On the morning of 12.8.24 Jordanne collapsed suddenly at home, and died a short time later.</span> A post mortem examination confirmed the cause of death to be a pulmonary embolism. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Her death would probably have been prevented if the pulmonary embolism had been identified and treated in hospital." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1) Jordanne's death arose because a locum doctor, said to be the most senior doctor on duty in the Emergency Department on 10.8.24, did not know that her CT scan taken that day would be reported in two parts. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">The initial report did not mention the presence of a pulmonary embolism, but did make clear that a second and final report was to follow.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: safety + patient + patient + training">The doctor proceeded to make the decision to discharge Jordanne without reading the second and final report, which highlighted the pulmonary embolism; 2) In her evidence at inquest, [REDACTED] ( Head of Patient Safety at the Trust ) confirmed: (a) that all of the Trust's own employed doctors receive training so that they ensure that both parts of any CT scan report are read; (b) that all new locum doctors working for the Trust are provided with an induction pack, which highlights the requirement to read both parts of any CT scan report.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: training">However, [REDACTED] was unable to confirm that steps have been taken to ensure that all locum doctors already working at the Trust have received the equivalent training.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: record + education">She indicated that they have been invited to attend education sessions in which this topic has been covered, but that no record is kept of whether those doctors did in fact attend.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
Keywords: conditions + training">I am therefore concerned that unless and until the Trust is able to ensure that all locum doctors working at its hospitals have received training about the need to read both parts of a CT scan report, there remains a risk that ( as in this case ) life- threatening conditions may go undiagnosed, and consequently that patients' lives may be put at risk. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as the Acting Chief Executive of the Trust, have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following: (a) [REDACTED] (Jordanne's mother ). I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 .</span> Minister for Health [REDACTED], House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA 1 CORONER I am Jacqueline LAKE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Norfolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 12 June 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Susan Elizabeth CLISSOLD, aged 72. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Sepsis Secondary to Infected Burn and Pressure Sore 1b) Multiple Sclerosis 1c) 2) The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural causes 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs Clissold had multiple sclerosis and was registered blind. She had carers four times per day. Mrs Clissold had a pressure sore on her sacrum which district nurses came in to dress. On 29 April 2024, Mrs Clissold scalded her leg with hot coffee and suffered a burn. This too required regular dressing. On 15 May 2024, Mrs Clissold was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with a temperature and low blood pressure and symptoms of infection. She was treated with IV antibiotics and fluids. Mrs Clissold's condition at times improved but then deteriorated. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

This report is being sent to: Kenny & Murphy Limited
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Director, Kenny & Murphy Limited 1 CORONER I am Vanessa McKinlay, Assistant Coroner for Somerset 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Ernest Kerslake.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Accidental Death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kenny & Murphy was the landlord company for Colley Lane Industrial Estate in Bridgwater where the accident occurred on 7 September 2023. Mr Kerslake's fatal injuries were sustained when he was tasked by a different company to strim vegetation at two specific sites on the estate. Having completed those two sites, he proceeded (uninstructed) to strim the vegetation at the foot of an electricity pylon on the estate. The machinery used was a petrol-driven brush cutter with a metal blade. In the course of strimming, Mr Kerslake cut through an 11kV electricity cable which was attached in the usual way to one of the vertical wooden poles of the pylon. The blade of the machine cut through the cable guard and the cable itself, causing the electrical explosion in which Mr Kerslake was injured. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Roland Wooderson Area Coroner for the coroner area of Gloucestershire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of CALLAN NORMAN COLLINS ATKINS.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was as set out below. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 18 May 2023 Callan was found hanging from a rafter at his home address. He was confirmed dead at the scene by a paramedic. The Police confirmed that there was no third-party involvement. He had recently undergone neurosurgery for epilepsy and believed that this had worsened his medical condition. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: mental health">Thereafter, an arrangement was made for a clinician from the mental health Crisis team to contact Callan on 18 May 2023 to arrange a face-to-face visit.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between + between">A subsequent enquiry concluded that there was an opportunity missed to conduct a face-to-face assessment on 17 May 2023 between Callan and a member of the Crisis team.</span> This would have been the ideal position. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

This report is being sent to: Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation | Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (Musgrove Park Hospital Trust)
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT DATED 31 MARCH 2025 IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive - Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Chief Executive - Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (Musgrove Park Hospital. 1 CORONER I am Philip SPINNEY, HM Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of The County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 25 May 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 25-27 March 2025. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + between + between">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The evidence shows that Mr Tizard-Varcoe's overall treatment for the ear infections between April 2021 and May 2022 was provided across three different health trusts and hospitals, Musgrove Park in Taunton, North Devon District Hospital in Barnstable and Exeter Hospital; it is acknowledged that this was as a consequence of Mr Tizard- Varcoe's vascular disease (being treated at Musgrove Park) and the locations of specialist doctors.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: access + between + between">Whilst being treated at Musgrove Park for a vascular problem, Mr Tizard-Varcoe consulted with ear nose and throat specialists for ear pain; subsequently between April 2021 and May 2022 he was seen on a number of occasions by clinicians in all three locations; this led to occasions when Mr Tizard -Varcoe was reviewed by clinicians without the full clinical picture due to the inability of separate hospital trusts to access each other's medical records.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The evidence revealed that on occasions it was difficult for Mr Tizard-Varcoe's GP to work out who had responsibility for his care.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + Yorkshire Contributory_Human Error- Violations
Keywords: treatment + optimal + not followed">It is my judgement that on occasions this led to less than optimal treatment for Mr Tizard Varcoe. (2) In addition, the evidence revealed that there were three occasions when Mr Tizard-Varcoe was not followed up as an outpatient in a timely manner (August 2021, November 2021 and February 2022).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On one occasion Mr Tizard-Varcoe possibly ran out of antibiotic medication and on another Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged without antibiotic medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: prescription + treatment + assessment">The lack of timely follow up appointments resulted in reduced monitoring and assessment and a poor understanding of the effectiveness of treatment and the progression of his ear infection. (3) In addition, on the 1 November 2021, Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged from the Royal and Devon Hospital without a prescription for oral antibiotics despite advice from microbiologists to do so; the evidence showed that this was a clinical decision made by a junior ear nose and throat doctor against an improving clinical picture.</span> <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: needs + time">The discharge was overseen by a consultant from a different specialism due to Mr Tizard- Varcoe's health needs at the time.</span> Evidence at the inquest from the responsible ear nose and throat consultant, indicated that he would probably have prescribed antibiotics on advice of microbiologists. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: treatment + coordination + optimal + areas + patient">Due to the progression of the infection from the ear canal into the bone at the base of the skull there is a real possibility that the clinical presentation did not reflect the true situation and this was a missed opportunity to provide continuity of treatment. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN (1) Consideration should be given to reviewing the process of managing and treating patients with multiple health conditions, being treated across different hospital trusts, to ensure greater coordination, collaboration and optimal treatment. (2) Consideration should be given to reviewing arrangements for follow-up outpatient appointments in the ear, nose and throat departments in the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and the Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, to ensure effective monitoring. (3) Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust to consider reviewing the arrangements for patient discharge in circumstances where a patient is being treated across different specialisms, to ensure that there is consultant oversight in all areas of ongoing treatment.</span> In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 28 th May 2025.

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Milton Keynes University Hospital
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 [REDACTED] - CEO Milton Keynes University Hospital 1 CORONER I am Tom OSBORNE, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Milton Keynes 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 21 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karl Fraser DUNSTAN aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative conclusion The deceased died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14th January 2025 from a pulmonary embolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">The opportunity to investigate and treat the pulmonary embolism was missed when the request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was declined without D-dimer testing and, when his clinical condition declined, was not met with emergency treatment for a pulmonary embolism.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Maternal and Neonatal Risk Factors
Keywords: thromboembolism">The missed opportunities more than minimally contributed to his death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Karl Dunstan died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14th January 2025 from a pulmonary thromboembolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis.</span> He had been admitted to the hospital the previous day with symptoms suggestive of a chest infection, but also with clinical features indicative of a pulmonary embolism, including shortage of breath, episodes of collapse and hypoxia. A request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was denied by the radiologist as it did not meet their criteria. There was a failure to perform a D-dimer test that if positive would have led to a CTPA that would have confirmed the pulmonary embolism. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">This would have resulted in thrombolysis being started when he collapsed. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: guidance + guidance + radiology">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: That the investigation of a pulmonary embolism was not carried out in accordance with NICE guidance, and a request for a CT pulmonary angiogram by the consultant was rejected by the radiology department because it did not meet the threshold of the Wells score used by the Hospital and yet a D-dimer test was not completed, that if positive, would have resulted in a CTPA.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

Keywords: mental health + policy + team">The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows: 1) Evidence from a senior member of North London NHS Trust's clinical leadership team revealed that there is a lack of a nationwide policy / approach to anti-ligature measures in mental health settings. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of the report, namely 18 August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following: Ms Crane's family; North London NHS Foundation Trust.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1) Chief Executive North London NHS Foundation Trust 4 th Floor East Wing St Pancras Hospital 4 St Pancras Way London NW1 0PE 1 CORONER I am Ian Potter, assistant coroner for the coroner area of Inner North London. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 September 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Louise Elizabeth Amy Crane, aged 39 years at the time of her death.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: areas">I acknowledge that the North London NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) has made progress in addressing some areas of concern the Trust identified during their own internal investigation, and that is to be commended.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Post-Event Learning and Improvement
Keywords: improvement plan">However, there remain some matters of concern that do not appear to have been addressed and the evidence also revealed other matters that have not been identified in the Trust's improvement plan.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: clear + staff + staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) Record Keeping / Professional Standards There was evidence that staff on Topaz Ward would sometimes use the ID card of another member of staff to makes notes on the records system, without making it clear who the entry was actually made by.</span> In this case there were two entries that appeared to have been made by a support worker, that were actually made by a nurse. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Such misleading and inaccurate record keeping risks significant confusion in the provision of care and potentially creates significant risk in relation to the continuity of care. 2) Lack of Professional Curiosity / Therapeutic Engagement - Audits This was a matter picked up during the Trust's own investigation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor
Keywords: policy">The Trust's action plan includes audits to monitor compliance with certain aspects of Trust policy etc.</span> However, the Topaz Ward manager gave evidence that there had been issues with audits in the past, which had been escalated (prior to Ms Crane's death) but no response received. I was not reassured that further audits would be sufficient to address the concerns already identified. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">In addition to the above, numerous members of staff from Topaz Ward gave evidence during the inquest and it appeared that many of them struggled with the concept of ‘therapeutic engagement'.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Some maintained that Ms Crane had received a sufficient level of therapeutic engagement from Ward staff, contrary to the findings of the Trust's own investigation and the subsequent findings of the jury.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: mental health + care + needs + care">This suggests a potentially widespread lack of understanding, and underlying knowledge of ‘therapeutic engagement' and its importance in mental health care. 3) Step down / discharge from PICU to acute ward There was evidence that the Trust's systems were unable to accommodate the needs of Ms Crane in ensuring that her transition from an intensive care to an acute setting was as safe as possible for her.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + needs + care + staff + staff">Numerous risks and needs were identified for the step down / discharge process, but most of these (which significantly impacted Ms Crane's risk to self) were not facilitated. 4) Therapeutic Engagement / Professional Curiosity - Generally The jury heard evidence from numerous members of Topaz Ward staff who were taken through the care records, that Ms Crane had become withdrawn from around 12 September 2024 onwards.</span> Many of the witnesses denied this, despite the evidence to the contrary. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: factor + factor + staff + staff + factor">The fact of Ms Crane becoming withdrawn had been identified by staff in PICU as a significant risk factor for Ms Crane.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff, patient">While this may not have been picked up by all staff due to record keeping issues (already identified by the Trust), the concern here is that there appears to have been a general inability among staff to recognise when a patient is becoming withdrawn, which raises concern about underlying professional curiosity. 5) Observations on Topaz Ward The Trust's own internal investigation highlighted issues regarding the review of required observation levels.</span> However, the evidence at inquest, in relation to the observation round at or about 11:30 on 19 September raised a further concern, albeit this did not cause / contribute to Ms Crane's death in the particular circumstances. The evidence was that the support worker conducting this check did not see any part of Ms Crane, and on trying to open the door noted there was some resistance. As such, the assumption was made that Ms Crane was sat with her back to the door, and the support worker marked Ms Crane as being in her room and moved on to the next room. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: policy + communication + between staff, between, staff + between, staff + culture">This raises the concern that observations being undertaken do not always comply with the Trust's own observation policy and that there may be a staff training / knowledge gap in this regard. 6) Communication and Culture While the Trust's internal investigation highlighted issues with documentation and record keeping, which is key tool for communication, the evidence revealed a lack of general communication between staff at all levels.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: safety + care + care + communication + patient">Aside from documentation matters, a lack of good communication more generally raises significant patient care risks and could undermine patient safety.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">The substantive consultant psychiatrist for Topaz Ward said that they would change nothing about the care that was provided.</span> This raises concerns that the senior clinician for the Ward does not accept or appreciate the issues identified by the Trust. 7) Trust Action Plan Some of the matters contained within the Trust's action plan, which stems from its own internal investigation, remain outstanding and / or are still awaiting Board level approval. As such, there is, to some extent, a lack of reassurance (at present) regarding the actions that will actually be taken to address the risks the Trust itself has already identified. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of the report, namely by 18 August 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of actions taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: quality + care + information + care">Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following: Ms Crane's family; and The Care Quality Commission, for information.</span> I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Ian Potter HM Assistant Coroner, Inner North London 23 June 2025

Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. Executive Medical Director Whittington Health NHS Trust Whittington Hospital Magdala Avenue London N19 5NF 2. President Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health 5-11 Theobalds Road London WC1X 8SH 3.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 June 2025. I made a determination at inquest that Finlay died from a rare (in a child) but recognised natural cause, a sigmoid volvulus. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Finlay's parents took him to the Whittington Hospital the night before he died, but the paediatric emergency department was understaffed and it was an extremely busy night. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: staff + staff">I heard at inquest that there have been many improvements in the paediatric emergency department at the Whittington since his death, not least of which has been the addition of more nursing staff.</span> However, a lack of paediatric nursing observations is a subject about which I wrote a PFD report on 13 March 2025 to a different hospital (the Royal Free) following the death of Billie Wicks. I remain concerned on two counts: 1. A lack of nursing observations may be a much wider issue than is recognised. In my experience there is nothing about the Whittington and the Royal Free that stands out as unusual. 2. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">The medical staff at the Whittington did not recognise the lack of nursing observations. · Observations were thought to be acceptable because they were not reported as otherwise, when in fact they were absent. · The discharging doctor decided that, if his final observations were normal Finlay could go home.</span> Those observations were never carried out, but Finlay was nevertheless discharged. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 August 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following: The parents of Finlay Roberts HHJ Alexia Durran, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons The family of Mr Cassin I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 June 2025. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a Pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents 1b Gastroparesis 1c Extreme Malnutrition The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: Died as a result of the effects of extreme malnourishment. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care">Opportunities to recognise the weight loss and escalate care were missed after November 2023.</span> It is not possible to say whether the outcome could have been prevented with earlier escalation. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased was aged 17 years of age. She had a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder and suffered with anxiety. She complained of symptoms of brain fog, syncope, blurred vision and chronic fatigue which she attributed to COVID 19 or a physical cause. She experienced significant weight loss. She underwent a number of investigations including for an autonomic dysfunction (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome) and no formal diagnosis was made. The investigations raised the suspicion of vasovagal response and deconditioning. She admitted to restricting her diet to manage her symptoms. The deceased was seen in the syncope clinic on 20 November 2023. Her weight was recorded as 42.9 kg with a BMI of 16.6. The Consultant Physician was concerned that the deceased was underweight and further investigation of her weight loss was appropriate. On 20 November 2023 referrals were sent to the General Practitioners, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and Dietetics to monitor her weight. By the time of her admission to hospital on 30 April 2024 her weight was 26.6 kg. I heard this was 50% of what would be expected as her median weight. From 20 November 2023 her weight had decreased by 16.3 kg. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Again, there was no exploration as to why that was the case and no direct contact with the deceased. (a) I am concerned the deceased was discharged from CAMHs on 12 December 2023 without being seen face to face or spoken to directly. (b) I am concerned there was no scrutiny as to why the deceased was reluctant to engage and not attend appointments. 4. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Consultant in Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Complex Spine Clinic, Princess Grace Hospital, London 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS Mr Patrick Viles died on 15/7/24 at the age of 28 years.</span> An investigation into his death was opened on 23/7/24. The inquest was concluded on 9/5/25. I reached the conclusion that Mr Viles died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Viles suffered from back pain, depression and insomnia. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Biases and stereotyping + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Mr Viles' death were as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">I heard evidence from several medical professionals regarding the risks that Mr Viles posed to himself and that this risk was recognised prior to his death.</span> You provided a statement, dated 5/1/25, for the inquest which set out the interventions that you and your colleagues had undertaken to treat Mr Viles' back pain in 2023 and 2024. No reference was made to any prescriptions that you issued and therefore, given the medical cause of death that had been proposed, I did not summons you to attend the inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">You did note that you had referred Mr Viles to a psychologist, who consulted with him on 19/6/24 and raised concerns regarding the need for urgent psychiatric input, given his suicidal ideation.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: not suitable">You also noted that you reviewed him after the psychologist's input and concluded that he was not suitable for spinal cord stimulation.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Green Range Limited, The Willows Care Home, 2 Tower Rd, Worcester WR3 7AF. 1 CORONER I am David Donald William REID, HM Senior Coroner for Worcestershire. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 7 November 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Vera Kathleen FORTEY.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs. Fortey "died from natural causes, to which an injury sustained in a recent accidental fall contributed" . 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In answer to the questions "when, where and how did Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Fortey come by her death?", I recorded as follows: "On 29.9.24 Vera Fortey, who had recently suffered a fall in her room at the care home in Worcester where she lived, underwent a hemiarthroplasty procedure to repair a fractured hip sustained in that fall.</span> Although making an uneventful recovery from the surgery, such that she was transferred to Wyre Forest Ward, Kidderminster Hospital for rehabilitation on 14.10.24, she became increasingly frail. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: treatment + concerns">Despite treatment, she continued to decline and died in Kidderminster Hospital on 5.11.24." 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1) Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Fortey suffered an unwitnessed fall in her room at The Willows Care Home, Worcester shortly after midnight on 25.9.24.</span> The carers who came and assisted her felt that she had not injured herself, and did not seek any medical attention for her. In fact, no medical attention was sought until shortly before midday on 27.9.24, when she was recorded as not being able to support her own body weight. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + time + care">The disclosure provided by the care home for the inquest did not contain: - any contemporaneous account of this fall written by either of the two carers who dealt with her at the time; - any entry made in Mrs.</span> Fortey's Daily Notes of this fall. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Furthermore, although there was a document which the then manager of the care home had written, which was said to summarize the accounts of the fall given to her by the carers concerned, this document made no reference to the date of the fall; I was forced to conclude that no contemporaneous account of the fall on 25.9.24 ever made its way on to Mrs.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: time + no time">At no time did she pick up on the fact that no account of the fall was contained on Mrs.</span> Fortey's file. 3) Before the fall in the early hours of 25.9.24 Mrs. Fortey was able to mobilise independently. After the fall, a number of entries were made in Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: staff + staff">Fortey's Daily Notes, which referred to her: - Being unable to support herself, having bad mobility and requiring a wheelchair ( 1626hrs 25.9.24 ); - Having very bad mobility and requiring a wheelchair ( 1848hrs 26.9.24 ); - Being very confused and agitated, with very bad mobility ( 0713hrs 27.9.24 ); Despite these obvious changes in her condition, no member of staff identified that these changes might have been due to the fall on 25.9.24.</span> Therefore in the 21⁄2 days after the fall, several opportunities were missed to have Mrs. Fortey medically examined, and for her fractured hip to have been identified and treated sooner. A significant reason for these opportunities being missed was the fact that the original fall was not documented in Mrs. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + time + care">Fortey's file. 4) Although she had only been in post since 13 August 2024, the then care home manager told the inquest that a reason why she may not herself have picked up on the above failings was because at the time of these events, she was still not familiar with the care home's records system, was unable to scroll through residents' notes, and was instead just "muddling through".</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: care + care + care + staff + staff + record">It therefore appears that insufficiently robust measures are in place at The Willows Care Home to ensure: (a) that staff understand the need to record significant incidents in residents' records; (b) that a regular auditing procedure is in place to help ensure that residents' records are being updated properly; and (c) that all staff at the care home ( including managers ) have received training so as to be as familiar with the computerized records system in use there as their role may require. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as the nominated individual responsible for the care home, have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following: (a) [REDACTED], Mrs. Fortey's daughter; (b) [REDACTED], Mrs. Fortey's son. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1.</span> Managing Partner, Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries, Alexandra Road, Lowestoft 2. [REDACTED], Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries, Alexandra Road, Lowestoft 1 CORONER I am Darren STEWART OBE, HM Area Coroner for the coroner area of Suffolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 09 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Terence COLBY aged 82. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 September 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural causes The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Peripheral Vascular Disease 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Terence COLBY was admitted to hospital with ulceration and purplish discoloration on the left fourth toe and swollen inflamed ipsilateral foot on the 19th August 2023. Mr Colby had been complaining of swelling and throbbing pain to his left toe since June 2023 which had been treated as gout. He had been assessed by a GP on the 17th August 2023. Mr. COLBY's family took him to A&E on the 18th August 2024 following which he was admitted on the 19th August 2024. Following assessment, Mr. COLBY was diagnosed with critical limb ischaemia secondary to peripheral vascular disease with an acute on chronic occlusion of his left leg and foot. Attempts at re- perfusion were made with no success. He had a below knee amputation to his left lower limb on 29th August 2023 and was stable post-operation. However, he developed hospital acquired pneumonia on 6th September 2023 and then suffered from a pulmonary embolism the following day (7th September 2023). <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: treatment + care + care + care">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the Course of the Inquest evidence was received in the form of a Report from an Expert in General Practice, commissioned by the Court and which considered the care and treatment provided to Mr.</span> COLBY by his GP Practice (Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries, Lowestoft). The Report highlighted substantially sub-standard practice provided to Mr. COLBY on the 17th August 2023 by Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries. This was as follows: On 17th August 2023, despite the presence of a wound on the foot and the report of leg pain, there was a failure by the examining GP to undertake a simple vascular examination of Mr. COLBY's limb. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance)

Keywords: care + care + care + national">In my view this was substantially sub-standard practice and a failure to provide basic medical care (failure to examine) and was against national guidelines." Although the Inquest did not conclude that the failure identified above was causative of Mr.</span> COLBY's death, I am concerned that should such practice continue, without remedial action, then there is a risk of future death in other patients. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 13, 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Holcroft Grange 2 Minster Care Group 3 1st Care 4U 1 CORONER I am Charlotte KEIGHLEY, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Cheshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 07 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Margaret Elizabeth DOUGLAS aged 82.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 04 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Margaret Elizabeth Douglas died as a consequence of naturally occurring disease, contributed to by injuries sustained as a result of recurrent falls. It has not been possible to determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, an acute event occurred in the period immediately prior to her death which contributed to it. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On the 1st June 2024, Margaret Elizabeth Douglas had an unwitnessed fall at home, having suffered a minor stroke and was noted to be experiencing increased confusion, slurred speech and difficulties mobilising. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Language competence (English)
Keywords: risk, assessment + language">Following a period of rehabilitation in Hospital, Elizabeth was admitted to the Heathside Assessment Pathway service to support her recovery and was assessed by the Speech and Language Therapy team as requiring level 2 fluids as she was at risk of aspiration.</span> Whilst at Heathside, Elizabeth suffered two falls, one of which caused a small bleed on her brain which was not identified on imaging at the time. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: risk">On the 22nd August 2024, Elizabeth was moved to Holcroft Grange where her risk of falls was identified as high and she suffered a number of further falls, leading to a decline in her condition, an increase in the size of her subdural haemorrhage, worsening stroke symptoms with her becoming increasingly frail and at increased risk of aspiration.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + needs + care + care">By the 5th September 2024, Holcroft Grange had identified that the were no longer able to meet Elizabeth's needs, considering that she required one to one care, however, they accepted her back without one to one care, following which, she suffered a further fall, causing injury to her face.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">A condition of Elizabeth's discharge was that one to one care would be provided, which Holcroft Grange outsourced to a care agency.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">In the days which followed, Elizbeth's condition deteriorated with a worsening of her stroke symptoms and a developing chest infection with a ceiling of care being put in place for her to remain at Holcroft Grange with input from primary care services.</span> On the 28th September 2024, it was noted that there had been a further deterioration in Elizabeth's condition, as she was unable to hold her head up and had been unsettled and often screaming. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: care + care + care + staff">Staff advised that she should be cared for in bed, but no medical advice was sought and consequently the deterioration in her condition was not assessed with no consideration of symptom management or whether she had reached a point whereby she required end of life care.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: risk">That morning, Elizabeth was provided with a drink, although it has not been possible to say whether at the time, Elizabeth was positioned correctly to avoid her risk of aspiration.</span> Soon afterwards, Elizabeth was laid down, stopped breathing and passed away. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Given the ambiguity of the evidence provided at Inquest, it has not been possible to determine whether an acute event occurred at that time which contributed to Elizabeth's death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

Keywords: care + needs + care + care">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) i) In the course of the Inquest I heard evidence that by the 5th September 2024, Holcroft Grange had already identified that they were unable to meet Elizabeth's needs, considering that she required one to one care.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + needs + care + care">Despite being aware that they were unable to meet Elizabeth's needs and that they were unable to provide one to one care, Holcroft Grange accepted Elizabeth back into their care, following which she suffered a further fall.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Peer Support and Supervision + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Language competence (English)
Keywords: supervision + care, communicating + information, needs + inadequate, care + care + risk + english">Agreeing to provide care for an individual in circumstances where it is known that the level of care that person requires to keep them safe cannot be provided, creates a risk that future deaths could occur as a consequence of inadequate care and supervision. ii) In the course of the Inquest I heard evidence from the individual who was caring for Elizabeth on the morning of her death and in the course of that evidence it became apparent that the carer had little understanding of Elizabeth's needs and had difficulty communicating and understanding information in English.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">The evidence given by those at Holcroft Grange was that they outsourced the provision of the one to one carers to a company, ‘1st Care 4 U Ltd' who had been approved for use by their parent company ‘Minster Care Group'.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor
Keywords: communication + care + needs + care + care + communication">At the time the care was provided, it was known by those responsible for sourcing the care, that there were difficulties with Elizabeth's communication and her complex needs.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Dignity/respect + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: concerns + respect + care + needs + care + care">This evidence gives rise to significant concerns in respect of the ability of those providing one to one care to understand an individual's complex needs and their ability to communicate with those who themselves have difficulties with their speech.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: concerns + needs + risk">The concerns were heightened in the context of this case given that Elizabeth was at high risk of aspiration and if carers are unable to understand the complexities of an individual's needs and communicate effectively with them, it poses a risk to their life. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 13, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons [REDACTED] I have also sent it to CQC Inquest Reports who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated: 18/06/2025 Charlotte KEIGHLEY Assistant Coroner for Cheshire

This report is being sent to: East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive, East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am Ms. Catherine Wood Assistant Coroner for North East Kent 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 6 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Upali METHTHANANDA. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was Narrative "He died as a result of bleeding from a severed blood vessel, a rare but recognised complication of thoracentesis. The haemorrhage occurred following the insertion of a chest drain to drain fluid from a left sided pleural effusion which arose as a complication of coronary artery bypass surgery for his underlying ischaemic heart disease." 1a Multi-Organ Failure 1b Hypovolemic Shock 1c Bleeding following thoracentesis (20 October 2023) for a pleural effusion following cardiothoracic surgery (3 October 2023) 1d II Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) in the Past 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Upali Meththananada was a 76 year old physiotherapist who despite his age was still working and active. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: medical history">He had a medical history of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and previous stroke when he began to suffer from chest pain in early 2023.</span> Coronary angiography revealed severe triple vessel disease and he was referred for coronary artery bypass surgery at St. Bartholomew's hospital. He underwent surgery at St. Bartholomew's on 3 October 2023 and his aorta was found to be heavily calcified so a decision was made to conduct the procedure without cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedure itself was complicated by bleeding and he required a number of blood products during surgery. He recovered following surgery but had a residual pleural effusion following removal of his chest drains but he was fit for discharge home when he left hospital on 10 October 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

He was initially stable but following the insertion he collapsed with signs of hypovoleamia at 15.45 . <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: care + care + time + documentation">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) I was concerned about the documentation as the inquest process had been hampered by the poor documentation and whilst I accepted that clinicians may have been providing care and not always documenting the care provided during this time the importance of documentation cannot be understated.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: lacking + record">However it was not just in the emergency setting where the clinical notes were lacking the clinical notes did not record key events and observations taken even in the period prior to his collapse.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: decisions">Clinical observations were not documented, meaning that trends were not available to treating clinicians and they would not have a full picture upon which to base any clinical decisions.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: between">Discussions between clinicians at other organisations were also not documented and forms used by the hospital for procedures were not used as required even by experienced clinicians.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + patient">Whilst I heard some improvements had been made by the witness who presented the Trust's action plan I remained concerned that the failure to document procedures and observations as well as advice given from third parties could lead to clinicians who take over care for a patient not having a full picture and leading to risks to patients in the future. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you the Chief Executive at East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13 August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Mr. Meththanada's family and Barts NHS Trust. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 . [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health and Social Care 1 CORONER I am Darren STEWART OBE, HM Area Coroner for the coroner area of Suffolk 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 03 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Louise ALDERSON aged 34.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 02 May 2025 which I heard with a Jury. The conclusion of the Inquest Jury was that: Narrative Conclusion - Mrs Alderson reported feeling unwell from 17th December 2022. She attended the GP Surgery on 19th December 2022. Observations were taken which were considered to be within normal range. Centor score of 2 was generated which indicated no anti-biotics were required at this time. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">An outer ear infection was diagnosed and a prescription was given for a topical anti-biotic spray.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling
Keywords: analysis">Redness of the throat was observed and a throat swab was taken to be sent for analysis.</span> It was recorded she was taking over- the-counter pain relief. It was advised she should return to the surgery if her symptoms worsened. Mrs Alderson reported feeling better on 20th December 2022 but then felt worse that evening. She then suffered bouts of sickness and diarrhoea throughout the night. On 21st December 2022 at 7am, Mrs Alderson reported this to her husband and went to bed. At 11am on the same day, her husband checked on her and upon observing a blue tinge to her lips, called 111. The 111 call handler triaged the symptoms using a computer- based system. Upon reporting a blue tinge to Mrs Alderson's lips in module 0, a category 2 ambulance response was triggered. The 111 call handler manually called 999 as the system did not automatically dispatch an ambulance. Mrs Alderson's condition worsened, and her husband made an additional call to 999. He was advised the ambulance was en route. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">The ambulance arrived at 11:57am and a Senior Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) made a clinical assessment of Mrs Alderson, including multiple observations.</span> The Senior EMT did not observe blue-tinged lips. Observations were generally within normal range, other than a slightly elevated temperature and heart rate. At the scene, the Senior EMT called Mrs Alderson's GP surgery and discussed symptoms and observations with the duty doctor. This was standard practice at the time. With no requirement identified for immediate hospitalisation, the ambulance left at 13:15. Mrs Alderson's conditioned worsened further and her husband left to purchase pain relief. Upon his return, he found Mrs Alderson in a state of collapse. She was unconscious but breathing. He called 999 immediately (14:09). During this call, Mrs Alderson stopped breathing. Bystander CPR commenced and an ambulance was dispatched at 14:15. En route to the scene, further backup was requested due to the report that Mrs Alderson had stopped breathing. The ambulance arrived at 14:26 and the ambulance crew took control of resuscitation attempts. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Leading Operations Manager Team arrived at 14:37, followed by the critical care team (HEMS) a minute later, who employed multiple methods of resuscitation.</span> Resuscitation attempts were ceased at 15:29 and Record of Life Extinct was completed at 15:54. The post-mortem examination carried out on 30th December 2022 found that the cause of death was as a result of multi-organ failure due to septic shock, arising from the rapid progression of a bacterial infection into the bloodstream. This infection was identified as beta haemolytic streptococcus infection, the presence of which was confirmed by the results of the swab previously taken for testing on 19th of December 2022. The toxicology report was unremarkable. It is therefore concluded that Charlotte Louise Alderson died of natural causes. The jury would like to express their sincere personal condolences to the family. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Multi Organ Failure 1b Septic Shock 1c Beta Haemolytic Streptococcus Infection 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH See Above Narrative 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment

A post mortem examination determined Mrs Hampson died as a consequence of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - The court heard evidence that in October 2024, Mrs Hampson sustained minor wounds to both knees in a fall outside her home. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Mrs Hampson was later seen on a number of occasions in the Emergency Department and referred herself to the District Nurses on 4 th October 2024 for wound care, remaining on their case load until her admission to Tameside General Hospital on 30 th October 2024.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + time + care">By the time Mrs Hampson's wounds were formally assessed in hospital by a Tissue Viability Nurse on 31 st October 2024, the wound to her left knee was described as ‘ 5.4cm x 13cm 10% necrosis (thick dark devitalized tissue) 40% slough (yellow devitalized tissue) 50% granulation tissue .' I am concerned that the Trust has not undertaken any serious incident investigation with a view to identifying if any learning could usefully be identified in the light of the progression of Mrs Hampson's left leg wound whilst under the care of the District Nurses.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: review + attendance">It is a further matter of concern that the court heard evidence that an Orthopaedic review undertaken in the Emergency Department on Mrs Hampson's initial attendance resulted in a recommendation that Mrs Hampson should be followed up in fracture clinic.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: clear">For reasons which did not become clear during the inquest, the evidence of the consultant orthopaedic surgeon was that no such follow up appears to have taken place. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13 th August 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT DATED 17 JUNE 2025 IS BEING SENT TO: NHS England. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">For information: Family of Greta Mary Ann Lewis Chief Coroner. 1 CORONER I am Philip SPINNEY, HM Senior Coroner, for the coroner area of The County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 16 July 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Greta Mary Ann Lewis.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 10-11 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Greta Ann Lewis died as a consequence of complications of a stroke. The short form conclusion of natural causes was recorded. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH In March 2020 Greta Mary Ann Lewis suffered a stroke which left her with right sided weakness. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care

Keywords: treatment">In March 2021 she became unwell and after initial treatment at home by her GP, on 12 March 2021 she was admitted to North Devon District Hospital.</span> Over the next weeks she was treated in North Devon District Hospital and South Molton Community Hospital. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: treatment">Despite treatment she became more unwell and frail.</span> Her final hospital admission was in South Molton Community Hospital where she sadly died on 12 July 2021 due to complications caused by her stroke. The evidence revealed that on 31 March 2020 Mrs Lewis was triaged in the emergency department North Devon District Hospital (NDDH) at 1402hrs; it was noted that she attended following a stroke, describing the onset of right sided facial droop and right sided arm and leg weakness at 1300hrs. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The hospital had been pre-alerted as this was a potentially time critical episode.</span> Mrs Lewis was assessed by the duty consultant and a junior Dr. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">Her symptoms and signs were noted and it was recognised that she was not eligible for thrombolysis (clot busting medication) as she was taking rivaroxaban.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: treatment + national">She also had a stroke severity assessment score calculated as less than 5, this is a national score based on the symptoms and is used to guide immediate treatment options.</span> This score meant that she would not benefit from a thrombectomy (the removal of clots by mechanical retrieval). This is a procedure only performed in Derriford in Plymouth or Bristol Hospital by an interventional neuroradiologist, this is a specialist and highly skilled procedure. Following a CT scan Mrs Lewis deteriorated further with worsening weakness and the addition of speech problems. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">This deterioration meant that she was now eligible for thrombectomy, however this was not available at NDDH at that time and she had missed the window of opportunity for a referral to Derriford which was 1500hrs.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: concerns + disability">A thrombectomy can reduce the risk of severe disability or permanent damage caused by blood clots, restore blood flow to vital organs and can potentially prevent limb loss or death in acute cases. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS The concerns relate to the provision of the thrombectomy procedure to patients suffering with a stroke in the South West.</span> During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F1F8E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres) + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: availability + time">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence revealed that there is a gap in the availability of the time critical and potentially lifesaving thrombectomy emergency procedure to patients that have suffered a severe stroke in the South West. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN Consideration should be given to reviewing the availability of thrombectomy procedures in the south west and consider the viability of a 24/7 service.</span> In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th August 2025 I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Category: Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths
This report is being sent to: Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Executive, Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust 1 CORONER I am Simon Tait, Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire East 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 6 February 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hazel Gambles. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion that: The deceased died as a result of naturally occurring frailty of old age. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: pre-existing">Her pre-existing Alzheimer's disease, coronary artery atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contributed to her death, as did a head injury sustained during an in-patient fall while in hospital. 1a Extreme frailty of age 1b 1c II Alzheimer's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery atherosclerosis, recent head injury 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Hazel Gambles suffered a fall at home on 10 January 2025.</span> She was admitted to Rotherham District General Hospital. She had not sustained any injuries in the fall at home but was felt to have community acquired pneumonia and was admitted for investigation. A falls risk assessment was done on admission identifying her as a falls risk, but the falls prevention measures section of the assessment was not completed, and no such measures were put in place. On 11 January at 00.18 Mrs Gambles was transferred to Ward B4. According to the Trust guidelines, a further falls assessment should have been done within six hours of admission to the ward but that did not take place. At 20.00 she had an unwitnessed fall and was noted to have injuries to her face. At 23.50 a falls risk assessment was done. The falls prevention measures section of the form was not completed. At 01.04 Mrs Gambles was reviewed by a doctor. The assessment should have taken place sooner given the injuries to her face and the fact that she was on anticoagulation. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review

Deceased name: Valerie Hill
Coroners name: Graeme Hughes
Coroners Area: South Wales Central
Category: Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards) | Wales prevention of future deaths reports (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: The First Minister of Wales
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The First Minister of Wales 1 CORONER I am Graeme D Hughes, H M Senior Coroner for the area of South Wales Central. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Valerie HILL . The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest 29/05/2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a Narrative. 1a Pnuemonia 1b Fall leading to periprosthetic fracture of femur 1c II Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), frailty of old age 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Valerie died by pneumonia and a fall leading to a periprosthetic fracture of femur. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: factors">COPD and frailty of old age were contributing factors.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: care + care">Valerie died on 11 March 2022 at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, following a fall at Ty Bargoed Care Home on 7 March 2022.</span> She endured a long lie on the floor of over 14 hours whilst waiting for an ambulance to attend. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities

Keywords: patient flow + inadequate + patient">It is possible, due to long ambulance handover times across Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board and inadequate systems in place to effectively manage patient flow that this contributed to the long lie. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: care + care + situation + staff + staff">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) On 17.2.22 you wrote (then as Minister for Health & Social Care) to the Chairs of all Health Boards in Wales, and inter alia , alerted the same to the following: - "The volumes of people waiting excessive periods for transfer from ambulance vehicles to the care of staff in Emergency Departments, in particular, has reached intolerable levels....I am concerned about the level of tolerance to such delays a require you to take greater ownership of this issue as a priority....the current situation cannot continue" The then, and continuing NHS Deputy Chief Executive [REDACTED] gave evidence at the Inquest.</span> He indicated that CTMUHB had been in Targeted Intervention since October 2022 (2.5 years) and he hadn't seen significant improvement in relation to 15 minute or 1hr handovers. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: faced + situation">In answer to my final question to him as to whether a situation akin to that which Valerie faced on 7 March 2022 could happen again today, he accepted that that was a fair conclusion and that the same risks remain in the system.</span> <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: outcomes">In the the three years since Valerie's death you have received multiple Prevention of Future Death Reports from myself and fellow Coroner's in Wales highlighting the devastating outcomes attributable to delays in conveying acutely unwell patients to hospital/ambulance handover delays.</span> Those risks continue and are of acute concern to myself and my Coronial colleagues throughout Wales. (2) Despite some relaxation in the guidelines set by the Welsh Ministers in relation to ambulance handover delays/timings in 2024, WAST continues to adopt the 15 minute handover expectation/assumption for their rostering. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: care + care">My concern is that this disconnect is having a significant effect upon how the system for conveying acutely ill patients in the community to hospital is operating and changes are indicated to address this system dysfunctionality. (3) On 17.2.22 [REDACTED], Chief Executive of NHS Wales wrote to you as then Minister for Health and Social Services & in relation to the then acute concerns she had over delayed ambulance handovers indicated as follows:- "A health and social care system leadership response is required to current operational pressures on a par to the Covid-19 response" [REDACTED] in his oral evidence confirmed that the response had not been on a par with the Covid-19 response My concern is that the prevalence and extent of such delays has become beyond intolerable and is leading to many acutely unwell patients in the community waiting for such prolonged periods for emergency care, dying directly & indirectly as a consequence.</span> <span style="background-color:#E6E6FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Service Design and Patient Flow + House of Commons_Fragmented care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Obstetric review + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: patient flow + clear + review + patient">The balance of risk in the system appears to be borne disproportionately by the patients in that category & consideration ought to be given to redressing the same. (4) In your response to my Prevention of Future Death Report in relation to Lynda Blackmore (PFD and your response annexed) you indicated inter alia :- "For the past two iterations of the framework, I have been explicitly clear of my expectation that Health Boards prioritise plans to improve timeliness of ambulance patient handover to free up ambulance clinicians to respond to patients in the community...I have also set a priority for improvement of patient flow." My concern is that the same has not led to any discernible improvement in ambulance handover delays & that consideration might be given for a review of the level of escalation that not only applies on this issue to CTMUHB but also those Health Boards across Wales.</span> <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation
Keywords: areas">I was repeatedly referenced at the Inquest by CTMUHB that their performance in many areas relating to ambulance handover times was not "the worst in Wales". 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9 th August.</span> Only I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to all Interested Persons who may find it useful or of interest. Also to Health Inspectorate Wales and to each and every Senedd member as I consider the concerns I have raised and the matters investigated at Inquest of such potential significance to all of their constituents. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

The Cause of Valerie's death was found to be: 1a Pnuemonia 1b Fall leading to periprosthetic fracture of femur 1c II Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), frailty of old age 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Valerie died by pneumonia and a fall leading to a periprosthetic fracture of femur. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) The identification of, and reduction of falls risks was a central feature of the evidence in the inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies
Keywords: care + care + care + staff + staff + material">WAST, in particular had highlighted that falls in care/nursing homes have contributed significantly to the volume of activity in the community, having a domino effect/impact on delayed hospital handovers. (2) The material provided at, and post Inquest is absent in evidencing that staff at Ty Bargoed receive any specific, relevant, or effective training in respect of the identification & documenting of falls risks to residents, and the mitigation that can be put in place to reduce those risks.</span> In particular, how the assessments ought to be approached and completed. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Yorkshire Contributory_Local Working Conditions- Drugs, Equipment and Supplies

(3) the material filed with me focuses upon how to move a fallen person/their management post fall, not the identification /assessment/documentation of risk in order to prevent/mitigate the happening of such events. (4) The exhibits to your statement at KL 1 page 58 appear to suggest that the risk assessment forms ought to be completed/counter-signed by a Registered Healthcare Professional.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED] , Chief Executive, Barts Health NHS Trust, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel Road, Whitechapel, London, E1 1BB Sent via email: [REDACTED] Cc: [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am Nadia Persaud, Area Coroner for the coroner area of East London 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 24 June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Norma Faye Campbell, aged 59 at the time of her death.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 June 2025 with a conclusion of natural causes, contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mrs. Campbell attended the emergency department at Whipps Cross Hospital on the 13 January 2024 at around 12pm. The emergency department was exceptionally busy due to patient acuity and patient numbers. Pressures were added to by the absence of a number of locum doctors, due to a pay dispute with the Trust.

Thereafter maximal efforts were made to resuscitate her, but sadly there was no meaningful recovery. She passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital in the early hours of the 14 January 2024. Mrs. Campbell was a 59-year-old lady who had no underlying chronic disease.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: inadequate">The inquest heard that the A&E department at Whipps Cross Hospital often has inadequate staffing and medical facilities to address the patient numbers and acuity.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: national">The inquest heard that overcrowding in A&E is a national concern. 2.</span> The inquest heard that it is not uncommon to find patients in corridors when they need to be monitored. On the 13 January 2024 there were more than 25 patients in the corridors. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">They were not receiving an appropriate level of care. 3.</span> There are often insufficient numbers of resuscitation beds. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

Keywords: care + care + care">In the absence of increased numbers of resuscitation beds, a system for continuous monitoring of observations in majors would significantly improve patient care. 4.</span> There is no electronic observation system in place within the A&E department of Whipps Cross Hospital (such as Live Note). Patients presenting with high NEWS scores are not therefore automatically brought to the attention of clinical supervisors. 5. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: care + care + care + team">The Critical Care Outreach Team (CCOT) do not currently attend A&E for deteriorating patients.</span> The overcrowding and lack of resourcing in A&E highlights the need for the CCOT to provide support to A&E patients as well as patients on the ward. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 August 2025 . I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

I may also send a copy of your response to any other person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form.

The medical cause of death was 1a) Pulmonary Embolism; 1b) Endometriosis, Treated with Oral Contraceptive Pill. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

She collapsed at home on 03 September 2024 and, despite the best efforts of attending paramedics and clinicians at Leeds General Infirmary, she died later that day. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation + I-SIRch_Internal - Availability (e.g., operating theatres) + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: inadequate, care + outcomes + availability + care">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The inquest was told that it is possible for the outcomes of NHS 111 online assessments to be made accessible to Emergency Department clinicians, and that the decision whether or not to commission that accessibility in a particular hospital rests with the relevant Integrated Care Board. (2) The inquest was told that the West Yorkshire Integrated Care Board has not commissioned accessibility to NHS 111 online assessments for the Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust. (3) If the NHS online assessment completed by Chloe had been available to the relevant clinicians at Dewsbury District Hospital, her history of oral contraceptive use and the suspicion of a pulmonary embolism would have been visible to them. (4) The availability of NHS 111 online assessments to clinicians in Emergency Departments may assist in the obtaining of a full history and may act as a failsafe against inadequate history taking in Emergency Departments. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 08 August 2025.</span> I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: Chloe's family; Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: mental health + staff + staff + local">She had requested a transfer as she had worked as an Occupational Therapy Assistant in her local area and hence knew and feared that mental health staff there would know her, such that she felt unable to contemplate returning to work.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Deceased name: Michael Barry
Coroners name: Sean Horstead
Coroners Area: Essex
Category: Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths
This report is being sent to: Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board | Department of Health and Social Care | NHS England & NHS Improvement
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board Department of Health and Social Care NHS England & NHS Improvement 1 CORONER I am Sean Horstead, Area Coroner, for the coroner area of Essex 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 th September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Paul Barry aged 46 years.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 30 th May 2025. Mr Barry died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex from a confirmed medical cause of death, following Post Mortem examination, of ‘Ia Pneumonia' and, under Part II (as having contributed to the death but not a direct cause): ‘Excessive use of Codeine'. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: medication + care + optimal + care">I provided a Narrative Conclusion confirming that the deceased died, despite optimal medical care following admission to Hospital, from fatal complications of a community acquired pneumonia on a background of excessive use of Codeine medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: medication + mental health + time">Notwithstanding evidence of the deceased's history of mental health issues and previous suicidal ideation, and an attempt to take his own life by way of overdose some three months prior to his death, the evidence did not disclose to the requisite standard of proof the deceased's intent at the time of taking excessive codeine medication in the period prior to his last hospitalisation. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The deceased had a long-standing history of mental health problems and illicit drug and alcohol misuse.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">By the time of his death Mr Barry's use of illicit drugs had significantly diminished (though he continued to ‘binge drink' to excess).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">However, he had developed a long-standing dependency on prescribed opiate based pain-killing medication following significant surgery some years prior to his death.</span> <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Diagnostic Testing and Specimen Handling + Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: analysis + medication">Whilst the evidence did not disclose the source of the codeine taken in excess prior to his death, the evidence positively confirmed that, absent concomitantly raised paracetamol levels, the codeine identified in the toxicological analysis was likely not from the medication prescribed by the deceased's GP Practice.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: medication + between + between">Accordingly, no direct causative link could be found, to the requisite standard of proof, between the prescribed medication itself and the death and, further, no finding or determination was made that was critical of the GP's on-going prescribing of the pain-killing medication.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)
Keywords: concerns + patient">However, the lack of specialist support to which the GP could refer the patient was a significant concern. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Notwithstanding the positive finding that the specific medication prescribed by Mr Barry's GP had not been the source of the excessive codeine taken prior to admission to hospital, compelling evidence was received at the inquest from a Partner at the GP Practice (with a particular specialism in this area of dependency-forming medications) that there remains no specialist commissioned service available for GPs to which they might refer their patients to manage reduction of their intake of prescribed dependency-forming medications .</span> This is in contrast to the availability of commissioned services for patients who are dependent on illicit drugs and/or alcohol. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)

I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons and others: The Family of the Deceased Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Fern House Surgery I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Royal Pharmaceutical Society 1 CORONER I am Elizabeth WHEELER, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Cheshire 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 06 December 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Simon HOCKENHULL aged 56.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Natural causes 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Hockenhull died at his home address on 5 December 2024. He had been diagnosed with diabetes in 2017. Since diagnosis, he had struggled to control this. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Technologies - Issues

Keywords: issues">The underlying diabetes and the associated gastro-intestinal issues made him more prone to contracting infections and more vulnerable when he did contract them.</span> In 2024, his diabetic control significantly worsened. He was admitted to the ICU multiple times over that year as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis. From 2 December 2024, Mr Hockenhull's brother and community healthcare professionals became concerned about Mr Hockenhull's health. On 5 December, he was found collapsed but breathing at his home. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: risk">In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the course of this inquest, I have heard that some diabetic medications and devices have a life span of 14 days. When two are prescribed, they therefore amount to a 28 day supply. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">I have heard that this can cause problems as there are some pharmacists who interpret a 28 day supply as a "month", and that it can therefore be challenging to obtain a further prescription within the same calendar month.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Monitoring
Keywords: medication + monitoring">For patients who already have a complex relationship with their medication and monitoring regime, the challenges this causes can mean that they then do not take their medication as consistently as they need to.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues
Keywords: impacts">For patients with a diagnosis of diabetes, this can have rapid and significant impacts on their health, including developing the life-threatening condition of diabetic ketoacidosis.</span> At the heart of the issue seems to be that a "month" is being inconsistently defined. Sometimes it means 28 days, sometimes it is a calendar month. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: prescription">The RCGP RPS "Repeat Prescription Toolkit" (October 2024) does not seem to address this issue, so it may be that prescribers and dispensers are unaware of this issue. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 06, 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Mr Hockenhull's family I have also sent it to Countess of Chester Hospital NHS FT who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Essex Partnership University NHS Trust
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Essex Partnership University NHS Trust 1 CORONER I am STEPHEN SIMBLET KC assistant coroner, for the coroner area of Essex. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On [DATE] I commenced an investigation into the death of Carol Taylor, aged 75. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 th June 2025. <span style="background-color:#D1E7DD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: patient + elderly">The conclusion of the inquest was death was due to natural causes, the medical cause of death being a pulmonary embolism. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Carol Taylor was a detained psychiatric patient being treated on a ward for elderly patients.</span> When she was found unresponsive in her bed during the night, the alarm was raised and a number of people attended to try to resuscitate her. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: concerns + care + care + training">Additionally, at least one of those employed health care workers was not up- to- date on her basic life support training. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Patient Factors
Keywords: staff + staff, patient + training + elderly">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) There is no system that prevents staff that are non- compliant with mandatory training, including basic life support training, from being able to work on EPUT in- patient wards. (2) This is a particular concern generally, but especially in hospitals such as St Margaret's where at least some of the wards specialise in treating elderly patients who are likely to be at greater risk of medical collapse than the general population. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8th August 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons : [REDACTED] (husband of deceased). I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

                        <td>The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) There is no system that prevents staff that are non- compliant with mandatory training, including basic life support training, from being able to work on EPUT in- patient wards. (2) This is a particular concern generally, but especially in hospitals such as St Margaret's where at least some of the wards specialise in treating elderly patients who are likely to be at greater risk of medical collapse than the general population. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8th August 2025.</td>
