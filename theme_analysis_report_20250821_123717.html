On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum's address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + Yorkshire Contributory_Situational- Team Factors

On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine's family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Keywords: concerns">At 00:33 a member of Kaine's family called the police to report their concerns.</span> A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check'. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: assessment">To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment.</span> He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle. During the period of restraint, Kaine's physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency. EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments

Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

Keywords: between + between">Lack of agreed joint agency policy between EMAS and the police on s.136 MHA 1983 detentions I issued a PFD on 17 July 2025, part way through the final inquest hearing, to raise my concern over the apparent confusion with both the police and EMAS as to the applicable joint agency policy dealing with s.136 MHA 1983 detention and conveyance.</span> Since that PFD was issued, the evidence has developed and the position at the end of the inquest was as follows: - The police confirmed that the document titled " Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures" has been ratified within their organisation and continues to remain the relevant joint-agency policy for s.136 detention and conveyance. This policy has been implemented for the police since its inception. - EMAS cannot confirm whether the above policy has been ratified in its current version within the organisation. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps
Keywords: information">They have confirmed that an employee at EMAS signed off on the 2021 version, but that this information was never disseminated within the organisation because the finalised version of the policy remained within that employee's email inbox.</span> The consequence appears to be that EMAS has never implemented this policy, rather they have been working to an internal policy for Mental Health Conveyance that contains different working standards. Acknowledging that there is no confusion for the police as to the relevant policy, and that they do consider that it has been implemented, I remain concerned. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: between + between">For a policy to be effective, all purported parties to that policy need to know it applies to them. - Internal disorganisation within EMAS has culminated in a situation where, even after a period of investigation between 17 July - 25 July, they are unable to tell the Court which, if any, joint agency policy applies to them.</span> They are unable to tell the Court whether they are still part of the relevant working group. EMAS have allowed a situation to perpetuate in which they appear, on the face of the policy documents, to be party to an agreement (which includes service level agreements for conveyance) when they simply do not know if this is correct. The upshot of this is that other agencies may be placing reliance on the conveyance terms within the policy when they are dealing with s.136 detention. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: mental health + access, quality + communication + higher + between, staff + between, staff + mental health + training + training + training + team">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments. (2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Patryk's next of kin. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Priya Malhotra 18 July 2025

                        <td>The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments. (2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme. (3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth. (4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use - 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals. (5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests on-going challenges. (6) First Aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 15 September.</td>

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS This report is being sent to: Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Chief Constable of Surrey College of Policing 1 CORONER I am Robert Sowersby, Assistant Coroner for Avon 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION AND INQUEST On 28 June 2023 my office commenced an investigation into the death of Amy Anne Levy.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 6 June 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety

' Police were notified at the time of her overdose but Amy's whereabouts were unknown: much of the evidence in the inquest centred on their attempts to find her address so that emergency services could be sent to help her.</span> This was an article 2 inquest, and in recording how Amy died the jury identified ‘ a catalogue of missed opportunities to obtain Amy's correct address ' by various bodies including Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: informed">Surrey Police were informed of the situation via a 999 call.</span> In the ensuing period of over 2 hours before Amy was found Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary both tried to obtain her correct address. As part of that effort calls were made by police (i) to Amy's family home in Surrey, and (ii) to her mother's mobile phone. Each call came through with ‘no caller ID' and went unanswered. Both police forces knew that Amy had taken an overdose at an unknown address and that her condition was deteriorating. Both forces had graded Amy's case as requiring an ‘immediate' response (the most urgent category). Despite that factual background, none of the officers or call handlers who phoned Amy's parents left a voicemail message. Having missed the call/s (from an unknown source or sources) Amy's parents did not know that there was an emergency, or that the police wanted to speak with them, and had no way of calling back whoever had called them. It is probable that Amy's location could have been obtained earlier than it was if the police had left a suitably worded voicemail for one or more of her parents. Amy died in hospital on 22 June 2023. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

[REDACTED], Cornwall Council 1 CORONER I am Andrew Cox, the Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 22/5/25, I concluded the inquest into the death of Callum James Hargreaves who died on 20/1/24 at the age of 32.</span> I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Multiple Injuries. I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD. He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed.</span> In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: local">Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol.</span> In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety
Keywords: medication">On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen.</span> He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: safety + mental health + mental health">He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment.</span> He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum's risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention. Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency
Keywords: informed">There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge.</span> Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard. <span style="background-color:#D1ECF1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_External Factors- National Policies
Keywords: locally">Callum's body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24.</span> He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">On the evidence, it is more likely than not that Callum has jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + guidance + guidance + mental health">At inquest, the court heard from Gail Ashton who was the AMHP involved in the mental health act assessment conducted overnight on 19 & 20 January 2024. 1) One issue that arose was whether Callum presented with an imminent and significant risk of harm to justify a short-term admission into hospital as is provided for in NICE guidance.</span> Ms Ashton said this was expressly discussed by the clinicians concerned. <span style="background-color:#FCE4EC; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Yorkshire Contributory_Organisational Factors- Support from other departments
Keywords: facilities">It was felt he was likely to be withdrawing and there were no resuscitation facilities available in Longreach.</span> She also said the vulnerabilities of others on the ward needed to be considered all of which contributed to the decision not to detain Callum in hospital. She accepted that this rationale was not recorded in the notes. 2) Callum was asked whether he wanted his mother (who he described as his rock) notified of his discharge. He said that he did not. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

Keywords: gaps + team + record + team">The expert who reviewed the case felt there were ‘obvious gaps' in the record keeping and that as Callum's mother was one of the few levers available to the assessing team, Callum's decision not to involve her should have been explored further.</span> You may feel these omissions should be learned from when assessments are conducted in the future and, in particular, when notes of an assessment are subsequently recorded. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25.7.25. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.
