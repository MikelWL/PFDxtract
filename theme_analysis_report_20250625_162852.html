In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities + I-SIRch_Organisation - Language barrier
Keywords: higher + barrier">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) There are no lifeguards stationed at the breakwater during higher risk periods in the spring and summer months (when the weather is good and the tides high), when children and young people have been seen/known to jump into the water from it. (2) Jumping from, and the water around, the breakwater is known to be dangerous. (3) The practice of placing a lifeguard at the breakwater at times of higher risk in the spring and summer months (when the weather is good and the tides high) had been in place historically and was known to be effective at reducing the risk. (4) I was not given, in evidence, a satisfactory or cogent explanation as to why that measure had been removed prior to DAVID's death, nor why that measure continues to be absent today. (5) Nor was I shown any evidence that other deterrence measures put in place since DAVID's death (including clearer signage and a limited-height barrier) are otherwise working effectively to reduce the risk. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND/OR your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 30 JULY 2025 .</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) 1 CORONER I am Kate Robertson, HM Senior Coroner for North West Wales 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 20 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Etta-Lili Stockwell-Parry (DOB 3/7/23) who passed away on 7 July 2023 (having received a transfer from the Coronial jurisdiction where Etta passed away). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 May 2025. A narrative conclusion was recorded with the cause of death as:- 1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy Etta Lili Stockwell-Parry was born at 40+13 gestational weeks on 3 July 2023 at 00:51 at Ysbyty Gwynedd in poor condition following an instrumental assisted birth. Etta was transferred later that day to Arrowe Park Hospital, Liverpool for specialist neonatal support where she passed away on 7 July 2023 as a result of inutero compromise which led to the condition from which she died. There were several opportunities not taken by those caring for Etta's mother antenatally including at 40+1 gestational weeks and at 40+5 gestational weeks and at 40+12 gestational weeks to escalate from a midwife to a registrar due to static growth which would have led to induction of labour and likely safe delivery of Etta. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">There were opportunities to identify concerns with Etta through her mother on the midwifery led unit on 2 July 2023 including properly conducting holistic assessments, properly completing partogram and manual palpation of maternal pulse which would also likely have resulted in earlier detection of distress and successful delivery.</span> Etta's death was contributed to by neglect. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Etta was born in poor condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd on 3 July 2023 where her Mother's pregnancy was uneventful up until 21 June 2023 (40+1 gestational weeks). <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: concerns">The concerns are as follows:- The neonatal investigation was not thorough.</span> The investigator did not obtain or request statements from doctors directly involved in Etta's resuscitation, nor did they meet with them to understand what had occurred. The investigation was based on records alone. The records themselves, identified as part of the investigation, were often incomplete or included retrospective entries. Despite this, the investigator nor the panel involved considered speaking to or obtaining statements from crucial individuals. <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care
Keywords: maternity">There was no sufficiently full contextual sharing of the investigation or its findings from a neonatal or maternity perspective.</span> Some witnesses had only received and read the report several weeks prior to the Inquest. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: staff">The memoranda sent to staff highlighting the learning did not include context or narrative around the circumstances of investigation.</span> Therefore, those not directly involved would not have been fully aware of the context of what had occurred. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues

Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to Etta's family and to the Chief Coroner.

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Chief Executive, Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff 1 CORONER I am Kerrie Burge, H.</span> M. Coroner, for the coroner area of South Wales Central. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26 June 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Martin Robert SAUNDERS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 rd . April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision. The medical cause of death was 1a Blunt Head Injury, including Basal Skull Fracture 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH These were recorded as follows: Martin Robert Saunders, aged 48, died on A4059 New Road Mountain Ash, on 17 th June 2023, which is a 60 mph road, with laybys and bends, locally described as a dangerous road. Martin's motorbike collided with a coach which had been making a right turn from a layby / parking area. A sweeping bend approaching the layby reduces visibility for those approaching or exiting it. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: faced + time">Martin's motorbike was not visible to the driver when he began his manoeuvre and Martin's reaction time when faced with the coach was further reduced because he had been overtaking other vehicles on the approach to the layby.</span> Despite best resuscitation efforts, Martin was declared deceased at the scene. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication

This report is being sent to: Department of Health and Social Care | Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport 1 CORONER I am Louisa Corcoran, Assistant Coroner for Ceredigion 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 August 2022, an investigation into the death of Christopher Brazil aged 45 was commenced, which I concluded on 15 April 2025.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Brazil unintentionally overdosed on benzodiazepines, which he was taking regularly and died a drugs related death. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Brazil had suffered from an accident some time before his death in which he sustained injuries that left him with pain; he also suffered with sciatica and he became depressed during the pandemic.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: medication + mental health">Mr Brazil accessed his GP and was prescribed some medication for his ailments but, in a bid to self-medicate in order to manage his pain and, at times, poor mental health, Mr Brazil also sourced additional medicines and drugs.</span> He was able to buy from illegal websites, which depicted themselves as safe, regulated, online pharmacies. Mr Brazil died after inadvertently overdosing on benzodiazepines. They were not prescribed by his doctor or the NHS. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: providers">Investigations by the police and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have found that these were bought by Mr Brazil from unlawful providers operating under these websites: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].</span> <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Fragmented care
Keywords: prescription + providers">Mr Brazil was able to buy prescription drugs from illicit providers on a regular basis; there are two A and E records in February and April 2022 of Mr Brazil being intoxicated on benzodiazepines, before he subsequently died from benzodiazepine toxicity in August 2022.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment
Keywords: mental health + physical">Mr Brazil was struggling with physical pain and mental health issues and was susceptible to using this unlawful method, which was quick and readily available.</span> On the last order made, the drugs were delivered the next day via Royal Mail. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Evidence shows that Mr Brazil was not suicidal, but he was anxious to manage pain and was not directed by a healthcare professional as to how much to take and when. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Medication safety + House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Guidance gaps + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: medication, prescription + access + providers + guidance + inadequate + patient + guidance">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) There are unregulated and unlawful websites offering prescription only medicines and controlled drugs, which look legitimate and are found easily from simple online searches; and these sites give rise to the following points (2) to (6) (2) Vulnerable and susceptible people are exposed to counterfeit or unsafe medications (3) There are insufficient or no measures to verify patient medical history before selling the medication and drugs (4) There is a lack of guidance regarding dosage (5) There are a lack of safeguards to prevent incorrect self-diagnoses or misuse by consumers (6) There is inadequate age and identity verification, potentially allowing minors to access restricted medicines and drugs (7) The fact that it is possible for unlawful and unethical online pharmaceutical providers to operate and deliver to the buyer within 24 hours means that these illegal websites may be more appealing to some than lawful sources. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 June 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Mr Brazil's family. I have also sent a copy of this report to Mr Brazil's G.P., the MHRA and the police. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Wrexham County Borough Council, The Guildhall, Wrexham 1 CORONER I am John Adrian Gittins, Senior Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 7 th of April 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Emma Jane Hill (DOB 26.9.81 DOD 6.4.25).</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">The investigation is ongoing at the present time but following a post mortem a provisional cause of death has been established as being 1(a) Blunt force head injuries. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are as follows : On the 6th of April 2024 the deceased was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle which was travelling in the direction of Nantwich along the A534.</span> As the motorcycle approached the junction for Holt village, it collided with a motor vehicle which appears to have been exiting the junction. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: concerns + risk">As a result of this collision the deceased sustained injuries which were incompatible with life and she was verified dead at the scene. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Following discussions with the Roads Traffic Policing Unit of North Wales Police, I am concerned that although at this location the A534 is a comparatively straight stretch road, the visibility from the junction when turning right out of the village in the direction of Wrexham may on occasions be obstructed by signage and/or by vehicles which are slowing to turn into the village. <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance
Keywords: risk + national">Furthermore as this straight stretch of road is subject to a national speed limit following a 40 mph zone, traffic may be accelerating or travelling at speed, thus creating risk both for persons exiting the junction and traffic which is continuing along the main road.</span> It is also my understanding that there have been previous collisions in this vicinity in the past. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Physical layout and Environment + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: layout + risk">Unless action is taken to improve visibility, reduce the speed of traffic or to alter the road layout, then there is an ongoing risk that further collisions will occur and that lives may be lost as a result. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 th of June 2025 I, the coroner, may extend the period.</span> Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Family of the Deceased and to the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) 1 CORONER I am Kate Robertson, Assistant Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 2 July 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Leanne Marie Carroll (DOB 6/9/1996) who died on 29 June 2024.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 March 2025. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + time + mental health">The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion that ‘Death was due to misadventure where Leanne had not been referred to the Perinatal Mental Health Service either during her pregnancy or at any point up to her death'. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Leanne Marie Carroll was aged 27 at the time of her death on 29 June 2024.</span> She had given birth to her first child approximately 8 months prior to her death. Leanne suffered from anxiety and, although not diagnosed, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + mental health">She sought assistance from her GP and she was referred in March 2024 to the Community Mental Health Team.</span> She was referred to an OCD support group. It was noted that her OCD had deteriorated since giving birth. Leanne died from the excessive consumption of prescribed and non-prescribed medications. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + concerns + time + mental health">At no time had any health professional referred Leanne to the Perinatal Mental Health Service who could have supported her. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - 1. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + mental health">The Perinatal Mental Health Service was established across the Health Board around 5 years ago.</span> <span style="background-color:#F3E5F5; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: awareness">It was accepted in evidence that there is insufficient awareness of the Service by health professionals including midwives, health visitors and GP's.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: access + inadequate + awareness">Whilst attempts have been made to raise awareness and encourage direct referrals to the Service (rather than via the Single Point of Access) this remains inadequate.</span> If health professionals are unaware of the Service then mothers-to-be and mothers who require assistance will not be fully supported. 2. <span style="background-color:#E0F7FA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Socioeconomic factors and deprivation

Keywords: access + decisions">The Single Point of Access meetings which occur on a daily basis by way of triaging referrals do not provide written records of the discussions had and decisions made.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: decisions + patient + record">This means that there is no written justification for decisions made or written actions and therefore these discussions and decisions do not form part of any health record for the patient which would be relevant to the overall management of the patient. 4.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Care quality and access issues + House of Commons_Consent/agency + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Situation awareness (e.g., loss of helicopter view)
Keywords: access + decisions + awareness">I am concerned that deaths will occur into the future as awareness of the Service is not at all adequate to health professionals, the Service is not adequately staffed and records of meetings and decisions made in the Single Point of Access are not documented. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 14 May 2025.</span> I, Kate Robertson, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Family of the Deceased and to the Chief Coroner. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

Keywords: medication + mental health + time + mental health">Rhiannon's mental health deteriorated at a time when she suddenly stopped taking SSRI medication and a result, she experienced withdrawal symptoms which caused anxiety.</span> Rhiannon was also concerned that she may have autism spectrum disorder, and her counsellor documented that she was displaying traits of this disorder. For at least a year prior to her death and possibly longer Rhiannon experienced suicidal thoughts. From May 2023 Rhiannon's suicidal thoughts and distress worsened although the full extent of Rhiannon's thoughts and distress was kept hidden from her family. In the months before her death Rhiannon started researching websites relating to suicide and in the month of her death, Rhiannon undertook a Tik Tok search of ‘drowning in the bath'. On 15 September 2023 Rhiannon accessed a website called [REDACTED]. This website describes itself as a community that discusses mental illness and suicide from the perspective of suicidal people, as well as the moral implications of the act itself and actively encourages people to commit suicide. It also encourages individuals to hide their thoughts and actions from their loved ones. There is no moderation of this website. Rhiannon used this website to download a detailed document entitled ‘[REDACTED] guide' which describes in detail how to use these medications to bring about death. There is evidence that Rhiannon used the internet to obtain [REDACTED]. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps

THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Chief Executive Swansea Bay University Health Board 1 Talbot Gateway Baglan Energy Park Baglan Port Talbot SA12 7BR 1 CORONER I am Kirsten Heaven, Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of SWANSEA & NEATH PORT TALBOT 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 18th February and 5th March 2025 I heard an inquest into the death of Jean Pike.</span> The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)

Keywords: mental health + mental health">In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts.</span> At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

Keywords: mental health + decisions + care + care + mental health">This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co-ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community - which is in fact what happened in this case.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Psychological characteristics (e.g., stress, mental health)
Keywords: mental health + care + care + patient + mental health">I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care.</span> This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board (‘SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal)

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: BCUHB, Ysbyty Gwynedd, Penrhosgarnedd, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 2PW. 1 CORONER I am John Adrian Gittins, Senior Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On the 3 rd of May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ann Margaret Cotgrove (DOB 10.08.51 DOD 03.05.22). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 20 th of February 2025. The cause of death was recorded as being due to 1(a) Peritonitis , Acute Liver Failure and Bronchopneumonia 1b Gall Bladder Perforation 1c Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to obstructive jaundice and the conclusion of the inquest was that the death was due to medical misadventure. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The circumstances of the death are that Miss Cotgrave had been admitted to Glan Clwyd Hospital on the 31 st of March 2022 and was being investigated to establish the cause of her jaundice. She did not undergo a required ERCP until the 19 th of April and on the 22 nd of April was found to have sustained a perforation which is likely to have occurred in the course of that procedure. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">By that time she was too unwell to undergo reparative surgery and she passed away on the 3 rd of May 2022.</span> The delay in her undergoing the ERCP was due (inter alia) to the consultant gastroenterologist requesting that advice from tertiary centre in Liverpool be obtained prior to the procedure due to a suspicion of malignancy. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Consent/agency

This report is being sent to: Aneurin Bevan University Health Board
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1 Chief Executive of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board 1 CORONER I am Caroline Saunders, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Gwent. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 02 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jean THOMAS aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 October 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Accident 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jean Thomas fell at home on 20/10/23 and fractured her hip. She underwent surgical fixation but developed post-operative sepsis. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
Keywords: concerns + conditions">Against the background of her underlying medical conditions the infection proved overwhelming and Jean died at the Grange University Hospital in Llanfrechfa on 26/10/2023. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Jean was known to have significant cardiovascular problems and from her admission there were signs this was worsening. Her blood pressure was low, which would normally be treated with intravenous fluids, but excess fluids would put more pressure on her heart, and thus she was also treated with a low dose of furosemide. The management of Jean's fluid balance was important for the following reasons; she had heart failure, she had chronic renal failure, she had signs of a superimposing acute kidney injury and she was scoring on the NEWS chart from admission, such that the algorithm required the fluid balance to be monitored. Jean had signs of sepsis. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">I find at inquest that Jean's fluid balance was not monitored, which I determined to be a failure in care.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff and patient (verbal) + I-SIRch_Person - Staff (characteristics and performance)

Keywords: care + care + care + staff + staff + staff">Whilst I could not find that knowledge of Jean's fluid balance would have altered the outcome, it is a matter of grave concern that this basic nursing care was ignored, and these important clinical indicators not monitored by the medical staff. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 December 2024.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Health Inspectorate Wales I have also sent it to Family Members Of Jean Thomas who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

This report is being sent to: Elysium Healthcare
REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: Elysium Healthcare 1 CORONER I am Caroline Saunders, Senior Coroner for the coroner area of Gwent. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 01 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Huw Irwin ERASMUS aged 34. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 05 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion Narrative Conclusion - Huw Irwin Erasmus was at risk of eating vegetation present in the grounds of the Aderyn Unit in Pontypool. Huw died from the toxic effects of consuming a large quantity of Yew leaves in the grounds. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">Those responsible for his care ought to have known that Yew trees were present, and the leaves were highly toxic and could be fatal if ingested.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: mental health + care + care + care">His death was an accident but it was contributed by a failure of those responsible for his care to identify and manage the risks associated with the ingestion of Yew leaves. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Huw Irwin Erasmus died on 11/11/2022 at Aderyn Unit in Pontypool where he was detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act.</span> Huw died from the toxic effects of consuming a large quantity of Yew leaves. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Huw did not consume the leaves with the intention of ending his life. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. <span style="background-color:#FFF3E0; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: Extended Analysis_Staff Wellbeing and Burnout
Keywords: mental health">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Huw was detained at Aderyn Mental Health Hospital from 8/8/2022 to 11/8/2022 under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
Keywords: time">During that time he was granted unescorted leave within the grounds of the hospital.</span> Huw had a propensity to ingest vegetation and it was a condition of his leave that he refrain from so doing. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_External - Policy factor + I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff
Keywords: policy + staff">The expectation according to the policy and from staff who gave evidence was that Huw would be assessed following a period of leave.</span> It was also anticipated that this assessment would on occasion include a review of whether Huw had ingested vegetation. There was no documentary evidence in the clinical records that Huw had been so assessed after a period of unescorted leave. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation
Keywords: staff + documentation">There was also confusion amongst staff about the nature of the assessment and the level of documentation required.</span> Ultimately, the issue was whether in fact these assessments had taken place at all. Although in the circumstances this was not a finding made by the jury, it raises the concern that a failure to understand the requirements of a post-leave assessment and suitably document the findings could result in future deaths. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 06 February 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons Family Members Of Huw Erasmus I have also sent it to Health Inspectorate Wales who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it. I may also send a copy of your response to any person who I believe may find it useful or of interest. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)
