Keywords: equipment + decisions + care + information + care + time + care + assessment">The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) Despite recommendations for falls prevention equipment being made by the Community Falls Service in August 2023, no falls prevention equipment was put in place by the time of the Deceased's fall in October 2024 (2) Despite the social worker expressing concern about the lack of falls prevention equipment on 27 September 2024, no falls equipment was put in place prior to the Deceased's fall on 4 October 2024. (3) Information about the Community Falls Service recommendations was not passed on to the family, or to social services. (4) On 5 August 2024 (following a fall, but before the more significant fall on 4 October 2024), the Deceased's family were told by the Deputy Manager of Howlish Hall that the owner of Howlish Hall "probably wouldn't want to pay for a sensor mat". (5) I received evidence that, subsequent to the Deceased's death, there had been a reluctance on the part of [REDACTED] (who was believed to be the owner of Howlish Hall Care Home) to provide adequate resources for falls prevention equipment. (6) Despite it being recognised that the Deceased lacked mental capacity to make decisions about where she lived and was unable to keep herself safe, it appears that the home did not make any application for a DoLS assessment for the Deceased.</span> Indeed I received evidence that when a new home manager was appointed at Howlish Hall in January 2025 none of the residents were subject to a DoLS, despite a large number of the residents lacking mental capacity. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 September 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. <span style="background-color:#FFF8E1; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Internal - Time of day (e.g., night working or day of the week)

(3) Information about the Community Falls Service recommendations was not passed on to the family, or to social services. (4) On 5 August 2024 (following a fall, but before the more significant fall on 4 October 2024), the Deceased's family were told by the Deputy Manager of Howlish Hall that the owner of Howlish Hall "probably wouldn't want to pay for a sensor mat". (5) I received evidence that, subsequent to the Deceased's death, there had been a reluctance on the part of [REDACTED] (who was believed to be the owner of Howlish Hall Care Home) to provide adequate resources for falls prevention equipment. (6) Despite it being recognised that the Deceased lacked mental capacity to make decisions about where she lived and was unable to keep herself safe, it appears that the home did not make any application for a DoLS assessment for the Deceased.</td>

REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: [REDACTED], Chief Midwifery Officer, NHS England via [REDACTED]; [REDACTED], President, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health via [REDACTED] 1 CORONER I am R Brittain, Assistant Coroner for Inner London North. 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATIONS and INQUESTS An investigation into the death of Alfie Lydon (date of birth 28/2/24) was opened on 26/3/24, following his death on 12/3/24.</span> An inquest was opened on 18/4/24 and concluded on 27/6/25. The conclusion reached was that Alfie died from natural causes. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Alfie was admitted to hospital on 6/3/24 after being found profoundly unwell at home. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: care + care + care">He was subsequently transferred to another hospital for intensive care support but sadly died on 12/3/24 from a then unknown cause.</span> A post mortem examination demonstrated that he died from the consequences of a viral infection. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: concerns + team">Prior to his admission to hospital, concerns had been raised by Alfie's parents to the community midwife team regarding the adequacy of his feeding and increasing lethargy.</span> <span style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Organisation - Team culture factor (e.g., patient safety culture)
Keywords: local + team">On two occasions midwives discussed Alfie with the neonatal team at the local hospital but admission was not felt to be necessary.</span> These discussions were not documented by the hospital doctors who took the calls and, on one occasion, not documented by the midwife who made the call. As such, it was difficult to identify who provided advice to the midwives and the rationale for the decision-making process. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Ultimately, given the overwhelming nature of the infection Alfie suffered from, I concluded that it was not likely earlier admission would have prevented his death. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Alfie's death were as follows: 1. I heard evidence that the vast majority of hospital Trusts do not have processes in place to document external calls from midwives to hospital teams. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication + House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning
Keywords: concerns + care + care + care">Concerns were raised that this can result in a lack of continuity and escalation of care, particularly with regards to parental concerns.</span> The hospital Trust involved has taken steps to document such calls now but this is undertaken on paper, which is subsequently uploaded to the hospital records. They plan to implement an electronic solution but not for some time. <span style="background-color:#FFFACD; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Organisation - Communication factor - Between staff + I-SIRch_Organisation - Documentation

Keywords: national, local">Given that this is not simply a local issue, this concern warrants raising at a national level. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressees have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9 September 2025.</span> I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care + House of Commons_Inadequate maternity care + I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Care planning

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. She may send a copy of this report to any person who she believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 15 July 2025 Assistant Coroner R Brittain

Deceased name: Leonard Moaven
Coroners name: Mary Hassell
Coroners Area: Inner North London
Category: Suicide (from 2015) | Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)
This report is being sent to: London Fire Brigade
Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: 1. [REDACTED], Commissioner London Fire Brigade 169 Union Street London SE1 0LL 1 CORONER I am: Coroner ME Hassell Senior Coroner Inner North London St Pancras Coroner's Court Camley Street London N1C 4PP 2 CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 8 August 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Leonard Moaven, aged 61 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 January 2024. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide. Dr Moaven jumped from the roof of his block of flats at 5.33pm on 26 July 2023. He had got onto the roof by using a ladder to reach his attic and, when he got there, punching a hole through the roof tiles. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Before he jumped off the roof, Dr Moaven called the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), who in turn called the London Fire Brigade (LFB). When police officers tried to negotiate with him, Dr Moaven appeared receptive to the idea of coming down off the roof safely. <span style="background-color:#FFD580; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Communication
Keywords: concerns">Police officers were reluctant to suggest that he return the way he had come, as by now it was raining and they were concerned that he would slip, and so he waited on the roof for firefighters to escort him. 5 CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.</span> <span style="background-color:#E8F5E9; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Jobs/Task - Risk assessment
Keywords: risk">In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.</span> In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. Dr Moaven rang police at 4.33pm, exactly one hour before he actually jumped off the roof. Police attended immediately and sought firefighter assistance immediately. <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: attendance">However, they reported to me at inquest that there was some delay in the attendance of LFB. 2.</span> <span style="background-color:#F8D7DA; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Record of attendance (e.g., failure to attend antenatal classes)
Keywords: attendance">Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance.</span> This had to travel from further afield and Dr Moaven became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 5.33pm when he jumped. <span style="background-color:#E8EAF6; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Dignity/respect
Keywords: respect">The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.</span> I did not take evidence from any firefighters at inquest, and so I appreciate that there may be elements of which I am unaware. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18 March 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

[REDACTED], sister of Leonard Moaven 3. HHJ Thomas Teague QC, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it.
